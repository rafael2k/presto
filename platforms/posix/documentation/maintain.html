<p> Miscellaneous details. </p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p> Linux supports <code>if_nameindex</code> which is in
POSIX <q class="stdinc">net/if.h</q> and returns an array
of <code>if_nameindex</code> with fields <code>if_index</code>
and <code>if_name</code> (at least).  Indices are positive integers, names are
stuff like <q>lo</q> and <q>eth0</q> as displayed
by <code>/sbin/ifconfig</code>; this isn't actually useful for our needs, as it
doesn't connect to IP addresses. </p>

<p> <a href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-06/6881.html">Ulrich
Drepper said</a> that <code>SIOCGIFCONF</code> only returns active interfaces
(but this is apparently actually a bug), while <code>SIOCGIF{NAME,INDEX}</code>
can query all defined interfaces, even ones that are currently down.  A reply to
that pointed to netlink facilities, for which <code>socket(AF_NETLINK,
SOCK_DGRAM, NETLINK_ROUTE)</code> sounds like it may give us something to select
on to discover when interface changes happen.  The disussion also
mentions <code>rtnetlink</code>, which is a sub-set of the netlink messages. </p>

<p> <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2000-02/msg00315.html">Elsewhere</a>
I find reference to <code>sysctl()</code> for BSD and Sun&mdash;my
Linux <code>man</code> pages only mention <code>sysctl</code> as a system
command (section 8) and its config file (section
5, <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>).  This also discusses <code>struct
ifreq</code>, as used on Linux, except that it doesn't have
a <code>.ifr_flags</code>, so it's a different structure; the one on Linux has
far more details (see <q class="stdinc">net/if.h</q>, near its end).
</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2553.html">RFC 2553</a> specifies lots
of details about IPv6 and integration with existing networking infrastructure.
Details include: </p><ul>
  <li> a complication with <code>struct sockaddr</code>: older BSD variants have
an initial 16-bit <code>sa_family</code> member which later variants replace
with two 8-bit members, <code>sa_len</code> and <code>sa_family</code>; those
using the latter form are required to <code>#define SIN6_LEN</code> if applying
the same to the IPv6 data-structure (so they probably define a similar symbol,
likely <code>SIN_LEN</code>, anyway).  This distinction is not contemplated in
the code of this module, although it might not matter. </li>
  <li><code>INADDR_*</code> constants are defined in native byte-order but the
corresponding <code>IN6ADDR_*</code> constants are defined in network
byte-order.  Likewise for the associated global variables, when defined.  Note
that <code>INADDR_LOOPBACK</code> is defined for the loop-back address
(presumably <code>127.0.0.1</code>). </li>
  <li><code>if_nameindex()</code> gets the names and indices for all interfaces
(and its return value must be released using <code>if_freenameindex</code>);
every interface, indeed, <em>has</em> a unique name and index.  Conversion
between these two is mediated by <code>if_nametoindex()</code>
and <code>if_indextoname()</code>.  However, this family of functions gives no
way to map an interface name or index to a network address. </li>
  <li> <code>getipnodebyname()</code> is a thread-safe IPv6-aware replacement
for <code>gethostbyname()</code>.  However, it forces separate calls for IPv4
and IPv6. </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p> <a href="http://osdir.com/ml/android-platform/2009-02/txtMqAVfOgqpr.txt">Android's
C library</a> has limitations, notably a lack of condition variables in
its <code>pthread</code> implementation, which I'll need to work round.  It also
mentions some interesting-sounding timer
functions: <code>timer_create()</code>, <code>timer_gettime()</code>, <code>timer_settime()</code>
and <code>timer_getoverrun()</code>, which appear to be POSIX. </p>

<p> Experiment with python's <code>netifaces</code> module reveals interfaces in
family <code>AF_PACKET = 17 = AF_LINK</code> may exist, as well as the more
familiar <code>AF_INET = 2</code> and <code>AF_INET6 = 10</code>. </p>

<h2>TODO</h2><ul>

  <li>
See <a href="https://bugs.opera.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=11060">outstanding
bugs</a> against this module.  Several of these don't relate to this module
directly (e.g. changes needed in <kbd>pi</kbd> that shall need matching changes
here; or changes needed elsewhere in core that follow on from some
ground-breaking work here), or are multi-module and have been fixed in this
module already. </li>

  <li> There are many <kbd>TODO</kbd> comments littered throughout the code,
too; easily found with <kbd>grep</kbd>. </li>

  <li> Keep the <a href="libc.html"><kbd>libc</kbd> requirements doc</a> up to
date. </li>

  <li> Now that <kbd>sys/</kbd> contains a canonical-ish system-system
implementation, it would make sense to review its <code>#include</code>s of
system header files; wherever such a <code>#include</code> is only needed by
this module, it would be sensible to remove it from <kbd>sys/</kbd> and specify
it in exactly only the compilation units of this module that need it. </li>

  <li> Review the option of moving some of the utilities from this module
to <kbd>utilix</kbd>, leaving only porting interface implementations here.  At
the same time, try to kill off <kbd>UnixFile</kbd> and <kbd>UnixUtil</kbd> if
they still exist. </li>

  <li> Although POSIX doesn't suffice to
implement <code>OpNetworkInterfaceManager</code> (see comments
in <kbd>../posix_network_interface.h</kbd>), it would make sense to provide
implementations suitable for use on Linux and FreeBSD (hence Mac). </li>

  <li> Arguably, <kbd>src/posix_main_thread.cpp</kbd> should be renamed
to <kbd>src/posix_core_thread.cpp</kbd>, to match the class it contains (but the
present name at least matches the (misnamed) porting interface it
implements). </li>

  <li> <kbd>src/posix_async.{h,cpp}</kbd>.  This whole component is
due for a refactoring; see comment early in the <kbd>.h</kbd> file; and
the <kbd>.h</kbd> may then be worth exposing in the top-level directory, for use
by code outside this module. </li>

  <li>&hellip; and <kbd>../posix_select_callback.h</kbd> should, as noted in its
file comment, be abolished: <kbd>plugix</kbd> should provide its own header,
specifying what it wants; or, better yet, the relevant code should be moved out
of <kbd>src/posix_plugin_callback.cpp</kbd> to somewhere in <kbd>plugix</kbd>,
which would simply <code>#include "platforms/posix/posix_selector.h"</code> to
access the definitions it needs; <kbd>plugix</kbd> could then even go so far as
to clean up the way it goes about managing these socket-callbacks. </li>

  <li> Some utilities provided by this module might profitably be moved to
cross-platform modules in core (e.g. <code>PosixTimeZone</code>, see CORE-26307)
or reworked to be based on cross-platform base-classes that core could define
(e.g. <code>PosixAsyncManager</code>). </li>

  <li> Retire <code>PosixIrregular</code> entirely. </li>
