<h2>Memory</h2>
<h3>OOM handling</h3>
<p>Because GStreamer uses GLib, proper OOM handling becomes virtually
impossible. From <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-Memory-Allocation.html">GLib's
memory allocation documentation</a>: <cite>If any call to allocate
memory fails, the application is terminated. This also means that
there is no need to check if the call succeeded.</cite> Even though
GLib will use Opera's memory allocator, it will terminate the program
on an OOM condition. Overriding this behaviour is possible, but would
be no better as GLib code is written under the assumption that OOM
will not occur.</p>
<h3>Memory usage</h3>
<p>GStreamer internally allocates and frees its memory, the
application (Opera) has very little control over this. All memory is
freed when the <code>MediaElement</code> object is destroyed (at the
latest).</p>
<h4>Tuning</h4>
<p>The maximum size and number of buffers in the queue between Opera
and GStreamer is controlled by <code>GST_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE</code>
and <code>GST_MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH</code>. There must be enough data in
the queue so that GStreamer isn't starved while waiting for Opera to
feed it the next
time. With <code>GST_MANAGER_RUN_INTERVAL=10</code>,
<code>GST_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE=4096</code>
and <code>GST_MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH=8</code> the throughput is limited to
~3 MB/s which is OK for now but might not be enough in the future.</p>
<h2>Thread safety</h2>
<p>Because GStreamer runs in its own thread(s), special care is needed
in order to ensure thread safety in the communiction between Opera and
GStreamer. A major concern is also minimizing the number of memcpy
operations, as every extra copy made significantly worsens
performance. Since Opera is not internally thread safe, it is critical
that memory (objects) allocated by Opera, after being passed through
GStreamer, are freed in Opera's thread context. The basic recipee to
make this safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>No callbacks from GStreamer to Opera, instead Opera periodically
checks GStreamer's message bus.</li>
<li>A single GObject is shared between Opera and GStreamer, any data
sent between Opera and GStreamer is passed via this object. The object
is protected by a lock which must be held before any access.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>In order to build GstMediaPlayer you need the header files from
<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gstreamer.html">gstreamer</a>
and
<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-plugins-base.html">gst-plugins-base</a>.
In Debian/Ubuntu these are packaged as <code>libgstreamer0.10-dev</code> and
<code>libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev</code>.
</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>If Opera is unable to play a file which does play in another
application using GStreamer (e.g. totem), the following command
contructs a pipeline similar to that of Opera. If this command works,
the problem may be within Opera. If removing the queue element marked
in bold solves the problem, the reason is that GStreamer can't
properly play the file without random access (i.e. seeking).</p>
<pre class="cmd">gst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=example.ogg ! <b>queue</b> ! decodebin2 name=decode decode. ! queue ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! volume ! autoaudiosink decode. ! queue ! ffmpegcolorspace ! videoscale ! "video/x-raw-rgb,bpp=32,depth=32,red_mask=65280,green_mask=16711680,blue_mask=4278190080,alpha_mask=255,pixel-aspect-ratio=1/1" ! ffmpegcolorspace ! autovideosink</pre>

<h3>Using GST_DEBUG</h3>

<p>In debug builds the Opera-specific GStreamer elements will also
produce debugging output via the GStreamer debug system. To enable
this, set the <code>GST_DEBUG</code> environment variable,
e.g. <code>GST_DEBUG=opera:4,default:3</code>. Setting
<code>GST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR</code> helps when debugging inside Emacs. See
the <code>gst-launch</code> man page for details.
</p>

<h3>Using Valgrind</h3>

<p>Since GStreamer doesn't use Opera's memory allocator (it is not
thread-safe), memory debugging is best done using
<a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>. To get meaningful
results, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable <code>FEATURE_MEMORY_DEBUGGING</code>, as this interferes
with Valgrind.</li>
<li>Set
<code><a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-running.html#G_SLICE">G_SLICE</a>=always-malloc</code>
in your environment, otherwise you'll get lots of spurious leak
warnings.</li>
<li>A suppressions file like
<code><a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/common/tree/gst.supp">gst.supp</a></code>
is necessary to suppress "leaks" from memory allocated by GStreamer
once per process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example command line:</p>
<pre class="cmd">G_SLICE=always-malloc valgrind --undef-value-errors=no --leak-check=full --num-callers=50 --suppressions=gst.supp --gen-suppressions=all ./desktop</pre>
<p>Additional suppressions:</p>

   Memcheck:Leak
