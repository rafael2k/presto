A subset of <git.oslo.osa:/var/git/gstreamer/gst-opera> is duplicated
in this repository in order to build GStreamer plugins for WebM on
UNIX. Modifications should be made first in the gst-opera repository
and then synchronized with this repository using
scripts/gst-opera-sync.sh. Note that script will not stage changes or
make a commit, it only puts the working tree in a state where one can
easily see the changes. Untracked files can be removed with git clean.

Note also that our modifications need to be published on
<http://sourcecode.opera.com/gstreamer/> in order to comply with the
LGPL license, so commit messages in the gst-opera repository should be
considered public knowledge.
