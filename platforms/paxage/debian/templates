Description: Do you want Opera to be kept up-to-date with the rest of the system?
 Opera can configure your system to include new version of Opera
 packages in the regular system upgrades. Enabling this option is
 highly recommended in order to receive security critical updates in a
 timely manner.
 .
 If you agree, Opera will install a file into /etc/apt/sources.list.d,
 so that Opera package is upgraded to an available newer final release
 as part of your regular system upgrade.
 .
 Note that, by default, Opera will only be upgraded to final public
 releases this way. If you want to get beta releases, too, you'll have
 to edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera manually.
