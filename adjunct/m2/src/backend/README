Naming conventions
------------------

All global names (class names etc) must be prefixed with the name of the backend.

examples: PopFolder, ImapFolder
          PopMessage, ImapMessage etc.



Networking
----------

Backends that need to be able to communicate over network has the
option to choose between creating OpSockets (low-level, handles UDP) 
via the OpFactory interface, or creating a NetConnection (simpler, high-level, 
encapsulates Comm) using the GlueFactory interface.
