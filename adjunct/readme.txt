# Adjunct module versions used for the Desktop Evenes product.

# This directory is used for modules that are not part of core, and
# also not part of a certain platform. Platform independent non-core
# code, one could say.

# Format of this file:
#
# Every non-blank non-comment line must name a module, optionally
# followed by a '#' and a comment to the end-of-line.
# The version tag can be blank, meaning HEAD.
