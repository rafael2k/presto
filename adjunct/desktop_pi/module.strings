/* Strings referenced in adjunct/m2_ui/.
 *
 * Comment lines of both forms valid in C++ are ignored.  Preprocessor
 * directives are allowed: the #if-ery around each string tag should reflect the
 * #if-ery around its use in the indicated file(s).  Strings tags may be
 * repeated to simplify matching the #if-ery (e.g. when used in two places with
 * different #if-ery).
 *
 * Please indicate which file a string is used in, to help others track it
 * down.  An end-of-line comment indicates the file(s) the string is in.  A
 * file-name comment on a line of its own applies to all subsequent lines up to
 * the next blank line; an end-of-line comment starting with + indicates more
 * files containing the string; other end-of-line filename comments transiently
 * over-ride the block rule.  Include commented-out string tags for string tags
 * that appear only in comments.
