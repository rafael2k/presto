Welcome to My Opera Mail

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Welcome to My Opera Mail. We provide secure, efficient and easy-to-use access to your email on almost any device; whether you are surfing on a PC or browsing with Opera Mini on your mobile phone, just head to <a href="https://mail.opera.com/">https://mail.opera.com/</a>. You can also connect your other email accounts and read all your messages in one place. Just enter your addresses and passwords in the account settings, and we will do our best to figure out the rest.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use a dedicated email client, like the one built into Opera, you can connect with these settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>IMAP server: imap.myopera.com port 993 (SSL only)</li>
<li>SMTP server: smtp.myopera.com port 465 (SSL only) or 587 (STARTTLS only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your Opera username and password can also be used to synchronise bookmarks and more between the Opera and Opera Mini browsers and to create your own blog or share photos on <a href="http://my.opera.com/">http://my.opera.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for choosing our service,</p>

<p>The My Opera Mail Team</p>
