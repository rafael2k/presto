  under any circumstances.
 </p>

 <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  Opera uses the <code>OpLanguageManager</code> interface is used for handling
  locale strings, as described in the documentation for the
  <a href="../../../modules/locale/documentation/index.html">Locale module</a>.
  The string that can be accessed through this interface are defined by the
  string database, <code>english.db</code> residing in this module.
 </p>

 <h2 id="Database">The language database</h2>
 <p>
  The canonical source of language strings in Opera is the
  <code>english.db</code> in this module.
  This is the only file to which you should make changes if you want them to
  carry through.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can use the <kbd>updatedb.pl</kbd>
  (see the "<a href="#Scripts">Scripts</a>" section below)
  for a semi-automated method of adding strings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that is <em>not allowed</em> to hard-code user-visible text in the
  Opera core source code!
 </p>

 <h3 id="identifierformat">Identifier format</h3>
 <p>
  Each string defined in the database <strong>is assigned an
  <em>identifier</em></strong>, which is
  used to refer to this string from the source code.
  This identifier must follow the pattern described below.
  Please note that only the string name may be referenced by core code, not
  the associated number (see below).
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three logical sections in the database, in which the strings are
  designated by their initial letter. Please note that they are stored in
  the same section in the generated language file, so identifiers
  <strong>must</strong> be unique throughout all sections.
 </p>
 <table summary="Naming conventions">
  <caption>Naming conventions</caption>
  <tr><th>Initial   <th>Use
  <tr><td>D         <td>Dialog titles and components
  <tr><td>S         <td>General strings
  <tr><td>M         <td>Menus
 </table>
 <p>
  Please notice that some strings have an <code>I</code> as the second letter,
  these were imported from Opera 6 or earlier.
 </p>
 <p>
  New strings are to be named on this form:
 </p>
 <pre>X_DESCRIPTIVE_TEXT</pre>
 <p>
  Where X is one of the initial letters as described above, and
  <code>DESCRIPTIVE_TEXT</code> is a short text describing the use of the
  string.
  Please note that the identifier <strong>must</strong> be unique.
 </p>

 <h3 id="requiredinformation">Required information</h3>
 <p>
  For each string, three different components
  <strong>must</strong> be defined in the <kbd>english.db</kbd> file, the
  fourth (description) <strong>should</strong> be defined.
  These are listed in the file on the form
 </p>
 <pre><var>identifier</var>[.<var>component</var>]=<var>data</var></pre>
 <p>
  The first entry is named only after the identifier, and does not have a
  component part.
  It is listed as <em>none</em> below.
  Please note that all these components are required for new strings.
 </p>
 <table summary="Database entry components">
 <caption>Database entry components</caption>
  <tr><th>Name          <th>Description
  <tr><td><em>none</em> <td>The old unique number associated with this string
                            (see below).
  <tr><td>caption       <td>The actual language text associated with this
                            string.
  <tr><td>description   <td>A comment about this string to aid translators.
  <tr><td>cformat       <td>Enable/disable c-format parsing for the string
                            (optional).
  <tr><td>scope         <td>A list of scopes <a href="#identifierscope">to aid translators</a>
 </table>
 <p>
  The components are described in detail below.
 </p>

 <h4 id="identifiernumber">Old unique identifier number (obsolete)</h4>
 <p>
  Previous versions allocated a hardcoded identifier to the string when it was
  created, but this system is no longer in use.
  New strings use only the new identifier, which means that you should
  assign the special identifier value of <var>-1</var> to these
  strings.
  This will suppress the string from being output when building language
  files for older formats.
 </p>
 <p>
  To keep the size of the language files down, the identifier string is
  inserted into an enumeration which is used run-time.
  This means that, <strong>at run-time all strings are identified by an
  integer value</strong> (the value of the enumeration).
  The numeric identifier is created by
  applying a djb2 hash on the name of the string, creating a unique number
  (see also the next section).
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever a string is changed in an incompatible way, the unique number
  <strong>must</strong> be changed, which means that a new string name must
  be created.
  The new string receives a new identifier, and the old string is kept so that
  translated versions etc. can be built for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The identifier name is the only one used in the Opera source.
  The <kbd>makelang.pl</kbd> script, described
  <a href="#Scripts">below</a>, is used to create the required code to map
  between the two (see below for more information).
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that not all platform's implementations of
  <code>OpLanguageManager</code> necessarily use the hashed identifier number,
  especially this applies to some embedded platforms.
  This is why only the enumeration value <strong>must</strong> be used in the
  Opera source code.
 </p>

 <h4 id="identifiercaption">Caption</h4>
 <p>
  This is the <strong>actual text</strong> that is to be displayed (and
  translated).
  This string should be written according to the
  <a href="http://guidelines.oslo.opera.com/style">Style Guide</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The language database is encoded using
  <abbr title="UCS Tranformation Format">UTF</abbr>-8, but most strings
  should be restricted to basic latin ("ASCII") text.
 </p>

 <h4 id="identifierdescription">Description</h4>
 <p>
  A <strong>short and descriptive comment</strong>.
  This comment is visible in most of the generated language files, and in
  the translation files that are sent to the translators.
  To avoid errors and misunderstandings in the translations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Runs of several strings with the same comment will be grouped in the
  language file, as long as they are kept together in the database.
  It is always a good idea to keep related strings together, to make it
  easier for translators to spot them.
 </p>

 <h4 id="identifiercformat">Cformat</h4>
 <p>
  This optional parameter can be used to disabled c-format parsing for
  strings that the makelang.pl parser incorrectly triggers as being
  c-format (printf style).
  If you find that the parser does <em>not</em> flag a string as
  c-format where it should, that should be filed as a bug.
 </p>

 <h4 id="identifierscope">Scope (translator hints)</h4>
 <p>
  The scope parameter is used as a hint to translators to indicate which
  platforms use different strings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current scopes are listed below.
  A full list can also be found in <code>makelang.pl</code>.
 </p>

 <table summary="String scopes">
  <caption>String scopes</caption>
  <tr><th>Scope    <th>Description
  <tr><th colspan=2>Core Components

  <tr><td>qt       <td>A string used by Opera Qt
  <tr><td>windows  <td>A string used by Opera for Windows

  <tr><th colspan=2>Deprecated scopes
  <tr><td>unsorted <td>An unclassified string used by Opera core code
 </table>

 <p>
  A string may list several scopes (comma separated), which means that it is
  valid in ALL of these scopes. Thus, a string defining the scope
  "mac,windows" is used on both MacIntosh and Windows.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scopes <strong>should</strong> be added for all components that can be taken
  out of the program.
 </p>
 <p>
  To create a new scope, edit the
  <code>makelang.pl</code> script, described <a href="#Scripts">below</a>,
  to list your new scope, else rebuilding the language files will fail.
  Look for the variable <code>%scope</code> in the script and add your
  new scope in the appropriate place.
 </p>


 <h3 id="updating">Adding strings or updating existing ones</h3>
 <p>
  Please note that only the module owner may add strings to the work branch
  of the strings module.
  More information is available in the <a href="index.html">main
  documentation</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  To add new strings to the database, please read the information above on
  the format of the database and then edit the <code>english.db</code> file
  appropriately.
  You can also use the <kbd>updatedb.pl</kbd> script, described
  <a href="#Script">below</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  Updating existing strings is allowed to correct spelling errors and
  grammatical mistakes.
  It is <em>not</em> allowed to change a string to mean something else, once an
  id and number has been allocated to a string, that id and number may never be
  used for something else.
  For the same reasons, strings should not be removed from the database, they
  should rather be "abandoned" so that they are not included in the language
  files that are built.
  Abandoning strings is done by removing the references to them from the
  <code>module.strings</code> files.
 </p>
 <p>
  To check that the database format is valid, run <code>makelang.pl</code>.
 </p>

 <h3 id="Version">Database version</h3>
 <p>
  To make sure the correct version of a language file is used with Opera,
  <em>LanguageManager</em> uses a database version number.
  Whenever a new release is made of the language database,
  the database version number
  <strong>must be increased</strong>.
 </p>

 <h2 id="Scripts">Scripts</h2>
 <p>
  See also the
  <a href="index.html#buildsystem">corresponding section in the main
  documentation</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you modify the scripts, there is a selftest script in the
  <code>selftest</code> subdirectory that can be used to verify that there are
  no regressions.
 </p>

  <h3 id="scripts-updatedb"><code>updatedb.pl</code></h3>
   <p>
    This script is used to add new strings to the string database.
    It provides a slightly less user-hostile way to add them than editing
    the database file manually.
    It lets you interactively enter new strings, and performs some basic
    consistency checks.
    It also allocates the new string id numbers automatically, and updates the
    database version for you when it writes the file out.
   </p>
  <h3 id="scripts-makelang"><code>makelang.pl</code></h3>
   <p>
    This script serves several purposes.
    For a list of valid parameters please issue the command
   </p>
   <pre>perl makelang.pl -?</pre>
   <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
      <strong>To generate the source code header files</strong>
      required to compile the Opera source code, since the source code need to
      be able to reference the strings that are listed in the language
      database.
     </p>
     <p>
      In <strong>core-2 and later</strong>, the script is run automatically
      from the
      <a href="../../../modules/hardcore/documentation/operasetup.html">operasetup
      script from the hardcore module</a>, which generates a
      <code>build.strings</code> file appropriate for your build and feeds it
      to this script.
      You will need to keep a copy of the <code>build.strings</code>
      for building language files (see below).
     </p>
     <p>
      When the script has been run by the build system, the following files
      include files
      <a href="../../../modules/locale/documentation/index.html#buildsystem">used
      by the locale module</a> and the code in Opera that accesses language
      strings are created:
     </p>
     <table>
      <tr><th>File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr>
       <td><code>modules/locale/language-dbversion.h</code></td>
       <td rowspan="3">
        Header files used for accessing information from the language
        database in Opera.
       </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><code>modules/locale/language-enum.inc</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>modules/locale/language-map.inc</code></td></tr>
     </table>
     <p>
      None of these files are checked in to the CVS.
      The internal test version of the language file can be used for debugging
      builds, it is not a proper language file for distribution.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      <strong>To generate platform-specific output formats</strong> to allow
      the integration into various platforms preferred format for string
      resources and/or translations.
     </p>
     <p>
      See documentation on the <code>-l</code> (ell) command line parameter
      for more details on what formats can be created.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      The <code>makelang.pl</code> script is also used to generate
      the run-time language files, either the English version embedded in
      the <code>english.db</code> file, or a translated version by specifying
      a <code><abbr title="Portable Object">PO</abbr></code> file on the
      command line.
      This usage is
      <a href="../../translations/documentation/index.html#scripts-makelang">described
      in the translations module documentation</a>.
      Please note that you will need to <strong>keep a copy of the
      <code>build.strings</code> file</strong> (core-2 and later) for
      reference when creating the corresponding language files,
      <strong>including the English one</strong>, since it
      contains the actual list of language strings used for your build.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      <strong>To generate translation template files</strong> that are sent to
      translators.
      This mode is usually not invoked directly, but instead the
      <a href="../../translations/documentation/index.html#scripts-makepot">makepot.pl
      wrapper script</a> from the translations module is used.
      Please see the documentation for this script for more details.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
  <h3 id="scripts-updatescope"><code>updatescope.pl</code></h3>
   <p>
    This script takes a string list for a build (the <code>build.strings</code>
    file) and tags all the strings listed in it with the given scope.
    This can be used by translators and the strings module maintainer to
    get a hint on where and by whom a certain string is used.
   </p>
  <h3 id="scripts-makespell"><code>makespell.pl</code></h3>
   <p>
    This script creates a text file with just the captions from the database,
    to make it possible to run a spelling checker on the contents.
