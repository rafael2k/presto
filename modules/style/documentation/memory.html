<h1>Style Module Memory Documentation</h1>

<h2>Used OOM policies</h2>
<p>
The CSSManager interface methods leave when OOM
occurs. SaveCSSWithInline(L) has two versions. One that leaves and one
returning OP_STATUS. The CSS parser leaves, but is trapped before it
reaches other modules through methods in the CSS class. RaiseCondition
is never used within the style module.
</p>

<h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>
<p>
An OOM situation during parsing of a style sheet needs to be handled
by the module calling
CSS::Load/LoadHtmlStyleAttr/LoadDOMStyleValue. The CSS object may
represent a partially loaded style sheet, so the best thing is
probably to delete the CSS object. The OOM failure is returned as an
OP_STATUS and is handled by the logdoc and dom modules.
</p>

<h2>Description of flow</h2>
<h3>Loading style</h3>
<p>
The CSS class has three entry points for parsing style. Load is called
from HTML_Element::LoadStyle (logdoc) for parsing full stylesheets,
where the HTML_Element is a LINK or STYLE element referring to the
style source. Imported stylesheets are loaded through dummy LINK
elements.
</p>
<p>
LoadHtmlStyleAttr is used when parsing an html style attribute string
(logdoc), and LoadDOMStyleValue is called from the dom module via
SetProperty. The two latter produces a CSS_property_list object, while
the former produces a CSS object.
</p>

<h3>CSSCollection</h3>
<p>
Only GetProperties and GetPageProperties are interesting when it comes
to memory handling. They can fail if allocating new CSS_Elm objects for
the selected properties fail. CSS_Elm are used as container elements
for CSS_decl objects which are selected for a given html element
during layout/display.
</p>

<h3>CSS Save</h3>
<p>
SaveCSSWithInline, which returns an OP_STATUS, is called from
SaveHtmlWithInline (logdoc) as a part of saving a document locally.
</p>

<h3>Local stylesheets</h3>
<p>
Local stylesheets like user stylesheets, style for wml, mail, etc. Is
loaded at startup and kept in memory until Opera exits. Some of them might be
replaced by a reload during execution of Opera if preference settings
change.
</p>

<h2>Heap memory usage</h2>
<p>
Heap memory usage is depending on the size of the stylesheets. The
source code is stored in the HTML_Element as an ATTR_SRC_LIST, even
after it is parsed and kept there until the element is deleted or
changed via DOM. This is not really done in the style module, but
still worth mentioning. The parsed style sheet is stored in various
objects for representing selectors, rulesets, and declarations. All
kept alive and referenced via CSS class objects. The CSS objects are
kept alive by the document to which it belongs via HLDocProfile.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the CSSManager contains CSS objects for the various
loaded user stylesheets. They are loaded at startup and lives for the
entire lifetime of the browser.
</p>

<h2>Stack memory usage</h2>
<p>
CSS_Ruleset::Match is called recursively. Max call depth depends on
the number of simple selectors combined in a selector.
</p>

<h3>Bison parser</h3>
<p>
There is one recursive rule in the grammar which is not
left-recursive. That is the rule for selector which is a combination
of simple selectors. So a very long list of combined simple selectors
will use a proportional amount of stack space:
</p>
<p>
<code>
DIV > DIV > DIV > DIV > DIV > DIV > ...
</code>
<p>
All other rules use left recursion, so the stack usage will be
shallow. YYINITDEPTH defaults to 200, but could of course be set to
something else if required.
</p>

<h2>Static memory usage</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A global CSSManager object (g_cssManager)</li>
<li>Various bison state machine jump tables</li>
<li>String tables for CSS identifiers (properties, values, media
types, media features, pseudo)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Caching and freeing memory</h2>
<p>
The parsed style information is stored with the document. If deleting
the style information (CSS objects) without deleting the document is
desired, deleting them is the responsibility of the document code
(logdoc module).
</p>

<h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>
<p>
The CSSManager object containing the local stylesheets is deleted in
the Terminate function of initcore. All other non-static memory
allocated via the style module is deleted with their respective
document.
</p>

<h2>Temp buffers</h2>

<h3>Current use of MemoryManager temporary buffers</h3>
<p>
FormatCssValueL and FormatCssNumberL uses GetTempBuf2k() to format
numbers, colors, and keywords.
</p>
<p>
Used a couple of places in the grammar in css_grammar.y to temporarily
get the namespace URI and name for adding a namespace and retrieving
the namespace idx.
</p>
<p>
GetMediaTypeString uses GetTempBuf() tempbuffer to return a media
string from a media type bit set.
</p>
<p>
HTML_Element attributes are copied into GetTempBuf2() to get tokenized
for matching attribute selectors.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>
FormatCssValueL and FormatCssNumberL use the tempbuffer to convert
numbers to strings using system functions and they copy the result
into a non-shared growable heap-buffer right away. So they won't be
overwritten. I have not checked whether the code calling into this
part of the style module (dom) is depending on temp buffers.
</p>
<p>
The attribute matching code is safe, because it is only using string
comparison and tokenization calls on the tempbuffer before it's
finished using the buffer.
</p>
<p>
GetMediaTypeString is not safe, because it is returned and used
virtually everywhere. One interesting part is that GetMediaTypeString
is used to retrieve the html element attribute value used for
attribute selector matching. So in the case of matching the media
attribute, the attribute is first generated into the GetTempBuf buffer
and then copied into the GetTempBuf2 buffer to be tokenized.
</p>

<h3>Rewrite</h3>
<p>
The tempbuffer use in FormatCssValueL and FormatCssNumberL can
easily be rewritten to use fixed size stack allocated strings, because
the maximum size needed for converting a number to a string is
relatively small and well known.
</p>
<p>
GetMediaTypeString is trickier because the string is returned upwards
with all the other attribute strings which are not supposed to be
freed by the caller.
</p>

<h2>Memory tuning</h2>
<p>
CSS_Buffer class uses less inlining when LIMITED_FOOTPRINT_DEVICE is defined.
</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>
None.
</p>

<h2>Coverage</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.richinstyle.com">RichInStyle</a></li>
<li>Opera's DOM CSS tests</li>
<li>Save with images as (page with linked CSS)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Design choices</h2>
<p>
CSS_Buffer class was designed to use the buffers from the DataSrcElm
objects to avoid duplicating the source. This has probably increased
the footprint a bit to handle strings across buffer boundaries
etc. Other design choices has been to minimize memory use by using
limited-size bitfields for storing pseudo elements/classes, and
integer types with low min/max values.
</p>

<h2>Suggestions of improvements</h2>
<p>
None.
