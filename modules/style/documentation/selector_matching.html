<h1>CSS selector matching</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
CSS selector matching is pretty straightforward, starting with the
subject and moving upwards in the document tree matching each of the
simple selectors until you have a match, or a failing one. There are a
couple of performance challenges being solved and described in this
document. One is the problem of reloading CSS properties for as few
elements as necessary when the dynamic pseudo state for elements
change. The other is an inherent O(n!) complexity for descendant
selectors (and indirect adjacent sibling selectors in CSS3).

<h2>Marking elements as possible targets for dynamic pseudo classes</h2>

<h3>Theory and rationale</h3>
<p>
In order to reload properties for as few elements as possible, we
would have had to store for a given element which other elements would
possibly affect a selector match for that element. That would have
required too much memory.
</p>
<p>
As a simple approximation, we mark elements which are affected by
dynamic pseudo classes with a bit per dynamic pseudo class. The
elements are marked during selector matching. Below is a formal
description of how document elements are marked.
</p>

<p>
Let document <strong>D</strong> be a set of elements in a given document, and <strong>G</strong> the set of selectors from the stylesheets which apply to the document.
</p>

<p>
Let <strong>S</strong> be a selector in <strong>G</strong> consisting
of <em>n</em> simple selectors (simple selectors as in CSS2.1)
<strong>s<sub>1</sub></strong> to <strong>s<sub>n</sub></strong> with
arbitrary combinators, and <strong>s<sub>n</sub></strong> be the
simple selector that matches the subject.
</p>

<p>
Let <strong>S'</strong> denote the selector that consists of simple
selectors <strong>s'<sub>1</sub></strong> to
<strong>s'<sub>n</sub></strong> where each simple selector
<strong>s'<sub>i</sub></strong> is the simple selector
<strong>s<sub>i</sub></strong> from <strong>S</strong> with all
dynamic pseudo classes removed.
</p>

<p>
Let <strong>E</strong>, consisting of elements
<strong>e<sub>1</sub></strong> to <strong>e<sub>n</sub></strong>,
denote a match for selector <strong>S'</strong> where each element
<strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> &isin; <strong>D</strong> matches the
simple selector <strong>s'<sub>i</sub></strong> of
<strong>S'</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Then, for every <strong>S</strong> &isin; <strong>G</strong>
<ul>
<li>For every <strong>E</strong> matching <strong>S'</strong>:
</li>
<ol>
<li>Mark <strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> with dynamic pseudo classes of
<strong>s<sub>i</sub></strong></li>
<li>Mark <strong>e<sub>n</sub></strong> with dynamic pseudo classes of
<strong>s<sub>1</sub></strong> to <strong>s<sub>n-1</sub></strong></li>
</ol>
</ul>

The reason for marking the subject <strong>e<sub>n</sub></strong> with the pseudo
classes of all simple selectors, is that e.g. hovering one of the
other elements of the match which has a hover pseudo class would
trigger a match of the whole selector and cause a reload of the CSS
properties for the subject.
</p>

<h3>Applying dynamic pseudo style</h3>
<p>
LayoutWorkplace::ApplyPropertyChanges is called for applying the dynamic
pseudo style. It marks properties dirty for the elements which needs to
reload the CSS properties based on the marked bits.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<pre>
selector:

  div:hover input:focus

document source:

  &lt;div&gt; &lt;input type="text"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
The div element will be marked with hover because hovering the div
will affect the selector match, and the input will be marked with both
hover and focus because hovering another element in the tree (in this
case the div), or focusing the input will require a reload of the CSS
properties for the input.
</li>
<li>
<pre>
selector:

  .myclass div:hover

document source:

  &lt;div class="yourclass"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
No element will be marked because the class selector doesn't match. If
the class attribute is changed to "myclass" via DOM, the div with the class
attribute will have the CSS properties reloaded and CSS properties
reloaded. The reload will ensure the pseudo bits are set correctly.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Hover</h3>
<p>
Updating dynamic pseudo style for :hover is a bit different because
when you hover an element, all its ancestors are automatically also in
their a hovered state. So when you hover an element deep down in the
tree, the body element is also hovered which can cause the whole
document tree to have the CSS properties reloaded.
</p>
<p>
Consider this example:
<pre>
selector:

  body:hover div#not_hovered

document source:

  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    ...
     &lt;div id="not_hovered" /&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    ...
     &lt;div id="hovered" /&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

When you hover the element with id="hovered", the body element will
also be hovered. That means that all child elements of body
potentially will have to have their CSS properties reloaded because of
the rules with the type of selectors as in the example above. So, the
properties have to be reloaded for not_hovered, even though it's not
an ancestor or descendant of the hovered element.
</p>

<h4>Hover reload properties optimization</h4>

<div style="float: right; text-align: center">
<object style="width: 400px; margin: 1em; border: 1px solid black;" data="hover.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<a href="hover.svg">
<div class="figcap"></div>
</a>
</div>

<p>
We have been re-applying hover quite inefficiently by doing:
<ol>
<li>Set hovered element to NULL</li>
<li>Cleared hover style for old hovered element</li>
<li>Set hovered element to new element</li>
<li>Loaded properties for new hovered element</li>
</ol>

This is particularly less efficient than necessary if the two elements
hovered between share a parent quite close in the tree which has the
dynamic pseudo bit set.
</p>

<p>
Say that we have a document tree like the one in Figure 3.1 and that
we have a stylesheet applied which causes the element nodes to be
marked with dynamic pseudo bits as indicated with the red squares. If
we hover between the two leaf nodes marked with the number 1. The
closest common parent (also marked 1) will have the save hover style
when both leaf nodes are hovered. That means we can get away with
recursively reloading the properties for the children of the closest
common parent.
</p>

<p>
In the case where we don't have a common parent with the dynamic
pseudo bit set, we have to reload the sub tree for both the old and
new hovered element starting from the top-most parent of the
respective elements with the dynamic pseudo bit set. This is the case
when hovering between the two nodes marked with 2 in Figure
3.1.
</p>

<h2>Descendant selectors</h2>
<p>
Descendant selectors can have any number of elements between the
matching elements of the simple selectors. This means a brute force
can be ugly performance-wise. Consider the case where we have a
selector of <em>n</em> div elements with descendant combinators:
<pre>
 div div div ... div
</pre>
and a document subtree consisting of n-1 div elements, assuming there
are no div elements in the dom tree which is a parent of the subtree
root.
<pre>
div
 \
  div
   \
    ...
     \
      div
</pre>
The selector will not match any of the n-1 div elements in the
subtree. But, consider how we would match the selector from the
subject and upwards in the dom tree. We start by matching the subject
which is the nth div in the selector and the (n-1)th div in the
subtree. Then, we start looking for candidates for the ascendant div,
and start with the parent. The parent ((n-2)th div in the
subtree) is a match for the (n-1)th div in the selector and this way,
we continue matching the divs in the subtree and the selector up to
the root div of the tree where we're left with an unmatched div
ascendant div in the selector.
</p>
<p>
Since this combination of divs doesn't match, we trace back to find
the next candidate for the subject ascendant, which is the (n-3)th div
in the subtree and continue matching from there.
</p>
<p>
So, for the nth descendant selector you have n-1 candidates for a
match. For the whole selector selector, that is
<pre>
(n-1)(n-2)...(1) = (n-1)!
</pre>
possible matches. This is just one example of the combinatory nature
of descendant selectors that can cause performance problems. We have
an optimization in our matching implementation, described in the next
section, which has worked well so far.
</p>
<h3>The match-to-top optimization</h3>
<p>
To remedy the O(n!) problem described above, we have a depth first
optimization starting with a tightest possible match for descendant
selectors that stops the search for descendant selector candidates
if we know that the selector cannot possibly match.
</p>

<h4>Tight partial match</h4>
<p>
Let <strong>E<sub>i,j</sub></strong>, consisting of elements
<strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> to <strong>e<sub>j</sub></strong> be a
partial match of <strong>S</strong> with <em>1 &lt; i &le; j &le;
n</em>.
</p>
<p>
Then <strong>E<sub>i,j</sub></strong> is called a tight partial match
iff for every descendant combinator separated
<strong>s<sub>k</sub></strong> and <strong>s<sub>k+1</sub></strong>,
<em>i &le; k &lt; j</em>, <strong>e<sub>k</sub></strong> is the parent
element of <strong>e<sub>k+1</sub></strong>.
</p>

<h4>Failed top match</h4>
<p>
Let <strong>E<sub>i,j</sub></strong> be a partial match of
<strong>S</strong> with <em>1 &lt; i &le; j &le; n</em>. And, let
<strong>c<sub>n</sub></strong> be the combinator between
<strong>s<sub>n</sub></strong> and <strong>s<sub>n+1</sub></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Then <strong>E<sub>i,j</sub></strong> is called a failed top match
iff one of these conditions hold:
<ol>
<li><strong>c<sub>i-1</sub></strong> is a child selector and
<strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> has no parent.</li>
<li><strong>c<sub>i-1</sub></strong> is an adjacent sibling selector
and <strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> has no parent.</li>
<li><strong>c<sub>i-1</sub></strong> is an indirect adjacent sibling selector and
<strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> has no parent.</li>
<li><strong>c<sub>i-1</sub></strong> is a descendant selector and
<strong>e<sub>i</sub></strong> has no ascendant element matching
<strong>s<sub>i-1</sub></strong>.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>The stop condition</h4>
<p>
Let <strong>S</strong> be a selector with <em>n</em> simple selectors,
<strong>E<sub>j,n</sub></strong> be a partial match for
<strong>s<sub>j</sub></strong> to <strong>s<sub>n</sub></strong>,
<em>1 &lt; j &lt; n</em>, for a subject <strong>e</strong> = <strong>e<sub>n</sub></strong>.
</p>
<p>
If there is a partial match <strong>E<sub>i,j</sub></strong>, <em>1
&lt; i &le; j</em>, sharing <strong>e<sub>j</sub></strong> with
<strong>E<sub>j,n</sub></strong>, which is both a tight partial match,
and a failed top match, there exists no partial match
<strong>E<sub>1,j</sub></strong> of <strong>S<sub>1,j</sub></strong>
and hence no match <strong>E</strong> containing the partial match
<strong>E<sub>j,n</sub></strong> of <strong>S</strong> for the
subject <strong>e</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I don't have a formal proof for this.
</p>
<p>
This means that we can stop searching for descendant selector
candidates if we reach the top of the document without a failure for
the tightest possible match of a selector containing descendant
combinators.
</p>
<p>
For the example with the n-1 divs above, we will get a tight partial
match, with a failed match to top for the first candidate for every
div we try to match. This saves us from trying out combinations of div
descendants that we know will fail.
</p>

<h2>Indirect adjacent selectors</h2>
<p>
Indirect adjacent selectors have the same O(n!) performance problem as
descendant selectors. A match-to-left optimization, orthogonal to the
match-to-top optimization, is implemented.
</p>

<h2>The matching algorithm</h2>
<p>Here is an outline of the actual matching algorithm</p>
<pre>
Match() ....
</pre>
To be continued... (Don't know if it's really necessary. It's quite
simple apart from the two optimization techniques described
above.)
</p>

<h2>Implementation notes</h2>

<h3>The pseudo stack</h3>
<p>
During the matching we do not mark the HTML_Element objects with the
pseudo bits before we see that the whole selector can possibly
match. Instead we push the pseudo bits and the HTML_Element pointer
onto a pseudo stack and commit the stack when we see that the matching
elements on the stack is part of an <strong>S'</strong> match.
</p>
<p>
Example:
<pre>
.nevermatch div:hover div:hover div:hover
</pre>
For the selector above, we push the matched div elements with a hover
bit onto the pseudo stack, but throw them away when we find out that
no ascendending element of the three divs have a class attribute that
contains "nevermatch".
</p>

<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The bit marking algorithm is only correctly implemented for
active, hover, and focus. Hover is the most crucial performance hit,
but the UI pseudo classes from CSS3 should use the same
algorithm.</li>
</ul>
