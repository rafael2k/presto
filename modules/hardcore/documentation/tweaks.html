<h2>What is a tweak?</h2>

<p>
A tweak is a small variation of a feature or API. One tweak can adjust
a buffer size and another can set the default text editor to be used
for example. A tweak is not supposed to turn on lots of new
funcionality.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Types">
<h2>Are there different kind of tweaks?</h2>

<p>
All tweaks work on ONE define. There are two types of tweaks, working
on this define. They can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the value of the define. Buffer size made configurable for
  example.</li>
<li>Define the define if the tweak is turned on. A specific behavior
  can be turned on this way</li>
</ul>
</a>

<a name="Add">
<h2>Who can add tweaks?</h2>

<p>
Tweaks can be added by all modules listed in <b>readme.txt</b> in the
folders <a href="../../readme.txt">modules/</a>,
<a href="../../../adjunct/readme.txt">adjunct/</a>
and <a href="../../../platforms/readme.txt">platforms/</a>. The tweaks
are read from the file <b>module.tweaks</b> if present in the module
root.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Where">
<h2>Where are the tweaks described?</h2>

<p>
Each tweak is described as part of its definition in
the <code>module.tweaks</code> file of the module that defines it.
</p>

<p>
The script that processes tweaks and <a href="api.html">APIs</a> and
generates the various related header files also generates an XML file
containing the information in the <code>module.tweaks</code>
files. This generated XML file is
named <code>modules/hardcore/documentation/tweaks.<em>version</em>.xml</code>
and uses an XSLT stylesheet to render in a semi-useful format
(including a colorful tweak/profile matrix).

	  The tweak owner is the name of the developer responsible for

	<dt>Description</dt>
	<dd>
	  The description should  describe the tweak in such a way
	  that the branch manager for a platform can easily understand
	  what the tweak does, without having to look at the source
	  code. If possible, it should also say something about what
	  configurations should enable or disable it. Can span several

	  be able to turn this tweak on. The items are separated by
	  "," and/or "and". "nothing" is a valid value. Not mandatory,

	<dd>
	  Type of tweak. Can be one or several of the following:

	    <li>performance - The tweak affects performance.</li>
	    <li>standards - The tweak is related to the standards we
	      support. For example, there might be a tweak to turn off
	      some seldom-used functionality in some web standard.</li>
	    <li>setting - The tweak affects some setting. For example,
	      default prefs values are tweaks with this category.</li>
	    <li>workaround - The tweak turns on some workaround for a

<p> Example tweak:</p>
<pre>
TWEAK_PREFS_PRINT_MARGIN_TOP		peter

	Defines the default top margin in millimeters.

	Category  : setting
	Define    : DEFAULT_TOP_MARGIN
	Value     : 250
	Depends on: FEATURE_PRINTING
</pre>

<p>
All products with <b>FEATURE_PRINTING</b> enabled will have to take a
decision on this tweak.
</p>
<p>
If the tweak is set to <b>NO</b> (the setting is not tweaked), the
default value will be used for the define. This
means, <b>DEFAULT_TOP_MARGIN</b> will be defined to 250. If the tweak
is set to <b>YES</b>, <b>DEFAULT_TOP_MARGIN</b> must also be define to
a value chosen by the product.
</p>
<p>
Example of a tweak which has no value:
</p>
<pre>
TWEAK_SVG_FIX_POINT			bratell

    Use fix point instead of floats in SVG. This will improve
    performance alot on devices with slow floating point calculations,
    but the SVG engine will lose precision so the output may suffer
    from rounding errors or number overflow. If this is turned on and
    you use libvega as backend to SVG, it's likely that you want to
    turn on fixed point in libvega as well.

    Category: performance
    Define: SVG_FIX_POINT
    Depends on: FEATURE_SVG
</pre>
<p>
This tweaks turns on the define <b>SVG_FIX_POINT</b> if the tweak is
set to <b>YES</b>, otherwise nothing is done. The define is set
automatically and need not to be set by the product, which is the case
when a Value-field is present for the tweak, as in the previous
example.

<a name="mainline-configurations">
<h2>How do I change or introduce a tweak in different mainline configurations</h2>

<p>
The build-system can be told compile the "current" or "next" mainline
configuration. Each mainline configuration has an associated version
number. If the setup script finds the
file <code>module.tweaks.<em>version</em></code>, it parses that
file instead of the <code>module.tweaks</code>. Thus a tweak can
be added or changed for only one mainline configuration.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to only keep the versiond
file <code>module.tweaks.<em>version</em></code> for the "current"
mainline configuration and use the default file for the "next"
mainline configuration. Thus on switching the mainline version
numbers, the versioned file can be removed and only the not-versioned
file remains.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> If the "current" mainline version is 2.3 and the
"next" mainline version is 2.4, and one module needs to use different
dependencis for one message on different mainline configurations, it
can use two files:
<dl>
  <dh><code>module.tweaks.2.3</code></dh>
  <dd>defines all tweaks for the "current" = 2.3 mainline
    configuration.</dd>
  <dh><code>module.tweaks</code></dh><dd></dd>
  <dd>defines all tweaks for the "next" = 2.4 mainline
    configuration.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
So if you want to add or change a tweak for the "next" mainline
configuration, look for the version number of the "current" mainline
configuration in <code>modules/hardcore/version.ini</code>. If the
file <code>module.tweaks.<em>current_version</em></code> exists, you
can edit <code>module.tweaks</code>.<br />
Otherwise copy <code>module.tweaks</code>
to <code>module.tweaks.<em>current_version</em></code>, add it to the
repository and modify <code>module.tweaks</code>. Thus the "current"
mainline configuration remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
The same applies if you want to add or change a tweak for the
"current" mainline configuration: look for the version number of the
"current" mainline configuration
in <code>modules/hardcore/version.ini</code>. If the
file <code>module.tweaks.<em>current_version</em></code> exists, you
can edit it<br />
Otherwise copy <code>module.tweaks</code>
to <code>module.tweaks.<em>current_version</em></code>, add it to
the repository and modify it. Thus the "next" mainline configuration
remains unchanged.
