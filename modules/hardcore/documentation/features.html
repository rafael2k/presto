<h2>What is a feature?</h2>
<p>
A feature is functionality implemented in the Opera source code. A
feature turns on some code which does something.
</p>

<p>
This is true for all features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The have names on the form: <b>FEATURE_NAME</b>.</li>
<li>They all turn on at least one preprocessor define.</li>
<li>They can be turned on or off by defining the <b>FEATURE_NAME</b>
  to either <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b>.</li>
<li>To be able to turn on a feature, it may require other features to
  be turned on (dependencies).</li>
</ul>
</a>

<a name="What_is_not">
<h2>What is not a feature?</h2>

<p>
A platform or product dependant feature may not qualify as a real
feature. A feature must be something other products may be interested
in. It's not worth polluting the features system with non-portable
features.
</p>

<p>
Functionality not ready for realease is also sometimes not qualified
to be a feature. Depending on the phase of the current core code this
may be more or less true. For example, if some functionality is
developed in the early-phase of core-x, it can be a candidate for a
feature, on the other hand if it is developed when some products
already have shipped or are in release-phase, that is, when core-x is
in late-phase, it may not be a candidate for a feature until the code
is of good quality (matching the state of the rest of core-x).
</p>
</a>

<a name="Where">
<h2>Where are the features described?</h2>

<p>
In <code>modules/hardcore/features/features.<em>version</em>.txt</code>.
Where <em>version</em> is the version number if the current mainline
configuration. Each mainline configuration has its own feature
file. The version number is specified
in <a href="../version.ini">modules/hardcore/version.ini</a>. E.g. the
feature file for the 2.4 version is
<tt>modules/hardcore/features/features.2.4.txt</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The script that processes features.<em>version</em>.txt and generates
the various related header files also generates an XML file containing
the information in features.<em>version</em>.txt. This generated XML
file is named
<code>modules/hardcore/documentation/features.<em>version</em>.xml</code>
and uses an XSLT stylesheet to render in a semi-useful format
(including a colorful feature/profile matrix).
</p>

<p>
See:
<script>
  writeVersionLinkList("features", "modules/hardcore/documentation/");
</script>
</p>
</a>

<a name="product_feature_file">
<h2>How does the feature system get the product's feature settings?</h2>

<p>
Each product must either define <b>PRODUCT_FEATURE_FILE</b> to the
file to be used or change features.<em>version</em>.txt and add
a <b>PRODUCT_FEATURE_FILE</b>-row at the top.
</p>

<p>
Then, the file is simply included like this:
</p>

<pre>
#include PRODUCT_FEATURE_FILE
</pre>
</a>

<a name="Add">
<h2>How do I add a new feature?</h2>

<p>
First, answer these questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your code platform independent?</li>
<li>Is your code protected by a single <code>#ifdef</code>?</li>
<li>Is your code of accaptable quality, matching the state of the
  current core code?</li>
<li>Does your code follow
  the <a href="http://wiki/developerwiki/index.php/Modules/CodingStandards">coding standards</a>?</li>
<li>Is this something product manager will be interested in turning on
  or off?</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the answers are all positive, add your feature to
features.<em>version</em>.txt and submit a patch bug.
</p>
<p>
Also consider if your code should instead go into
the <a href="tweaks.html">TWEAKS</a> system.

<h2>What is the syntax for features.<em>version</em>.txt?</h2>

<pre>
FEATURE_NAME					feature-owner

	Description text.

	Defines       : preprocessor-defines
	Undefines     : preprocessor-defines
	Group         : group
	Depends on    : feature-list
	Required by   : feature-list
	Conflicts with: feature-list
        Enabled for   : profile-list
        Disabled for  : profile-list
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>feature-owner</dt>
	<dd>
	  The feature owner is the name of the developer responsible
	  for the feature. If this value is set to "deprecated" it
	  means the feature is no longer available. The feature cannot
	  be set (to <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b>), and an error will be
	  produced if it is set. Mandatory.
	</dd>
	<dt>Description</dt>
	<dd>
	  The description should describe the feature in such a way
	  that the branch manager for a  platform can easily
	  understand what the feature does, without having to look at
	  the source code. If possible, it should also say  something
	  about what configurations should enable or disable it. Can
	  span several lines. Mandatory.
	</dd>
	<dt>Defines</dt>
	<dd>
	  A list of preprocessor defines separated by "," and/or
	  "and". These will be defined when the feature is set
	  to <b>YES</b> and be undefined when the feature is set to
	  NO. Undefines or Defines is mandatory for every feature.
	</dd>
	<dt>Undefines</dt>
	<dd>
	  A list of preprocessor defines separated by "," and/or
	  "and". These will be undefined when the feature is set to NO
	  and defined when the feature is set to <b>YES</b>. For
	  example, <b>FEATURE_MOUSE</b> has Undefines set
	  to <b>MOUSELESS</b>, which means that <b>FEATURE_MOUSE</b>
	  set to <b>NO</b> will define <b>MOUSELESS</b>. Undefines or
	  Defines is mandatory for every feature.
	</dd>
	<dt>Group</dt>
	<dd>
	  Documentation purpose to make it easier to see which
	  features belong together. Is used by the editor.pike
	  tool. Not mandatory.
	</dd>
	<dt>Depends on</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of features which this feature depends on. The other
	  features must be turned on to be able to turn this feature
	  on. The features are separated by "," and/or
	  "and". "nothing" is a valid value. Not mandatory, if left
	  out it means "nothing".
	</dd>
	<dt>Required by</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of features which depend on this feature. The features
	  are separated by "," and/or "and". "nothing" is a valid
	  value. Not mandatory, if left out it means "nothing".
	</dd>
	<dt>Conflicts with</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of features which cannot be turned on if this feature
	  is turned on. The features are separated by "," and/or
	  "and". "nothing" is a valid value. Not mandatory, if left
	  out it means "nothing".
	</dd>
	<dt>Enabled for</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of profiles for which this feature is enabled by
	  default.  For each listed profile X, the file
	  hardcore/features/profile_X.h will contain the
	  line <code>#define FEATURE_WHATEVER YES</code>.  The value
	  special value "none" means the feature is not enabled for
	  any profiles by default.
	</dd>
	<dt>Disabled for</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of profiles for which this feature is disabled by
	  default.  For each listed profile X, the file
	  hardcore/features/profile_X.h will contain the
	  line <code>#define FEATURE_WHATEVER NO</code>.  The value
	  special value "none" means the feature is not disabled for
	  any profiles by default.
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE							peter

	Makes preferences support writing. Enables all APIs to save
	preferences, and also turns on support for writing generic INI files.
	Most normal platforms will want to enable this.

	Defines     : PREFS_WRITE, PREFSFILE_WRITE
	Undefines   : PREFS_NO_WRITE
	Group       : prefs
	Depends on  : nothing
	Required by : FEATURE_OPERACONFIG_URL, FEATURE_PREFS_DOWNLOAD
	Enabled for : desktop, smartphone, tv
	Disabled for: minimal, mini
</pre>

<p>
Let's look at the autogenerated code which turns on defines
for <b>FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE</b>:
</p>

<pre>
#if FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE == YES
# undef PREFSFILE_WRITE
# define PREFSFILE_WRITE
# undef PREFS_WRITE
# define PREFS_WRITE
#else
# undef PREFS_NO_WRITE
# define PREFS_NO_WRITE
# endif // FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE
</pre>

<p>
This means the "Defines" defines are turned on if set to <b>YES</b>
and the "Undefines" are turned on if set to <b>NO</b>. This feature is
required by <b>FEATURE_OPERACONFIG_URL</b>
and <b>FEATURE_PREFS_DOWNLOAD</b> which means neither of them can be
turned on if <b>FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE</b> is set to <b>NO</b>.
