<h2>What is the API system?</h2>

<p>
The API system allows modules to export API's, to be used by other
modules. When importing an API it means a module wants to make use of
some functionality exported by another module (or the same
module). For example one module might export a utility-function, which
is enabled by importing an API.
</p>
<p>
Each module present in <b>readme.txt</b>
in <b>modules/</b>, <b>adjunct/</b> or <b>platforms/</b> can have
a <b>module.export</b> file where the API's exported by the module are
described, and a <b>module.import</b> file where the API's imported
from other modules are stated. These files are put in the root of the
module.
</p>
<p>
An API being imported basically means that a preprocessor define is
turned on. The define can be used in all source files and is turned on
right after features and tweaks are turned on. This means that the API
system will be included from <b>core/pch.h</b>.
</p>
<p>
If an API is exported, but never imported, it will not be enabled and
its preprocessor define will not be turned on.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Usecase">
<h2>Usecase</h2>

<p>
Kurt wants to take a screenshot and store it as a PNG image on his
hard drive.
</p>

<p>
Here the problem is to find a function which can encode an image as a
PNG. It turns out that the ogp module has such a
function: <code>EncodeImagePNG</code>.
</p>
<p>
To use this function Kurt needs to enable <b>FEATURE_CANVAS</b>. This
might not be what he wanted. A better solution is:
</p>
<p>
ogp moves <code>EncodeImagePNG</code> and use a new
define, <b>PNG_ENCODE_SUPPORT</b> for example, to protect the
code. ogp exports the new API as: <b>API_ENCODE_PNG</b>. ogp will
import this API if <b>FEATURE_CANVAS</b> is turned on and Kurt will
import the API from his code whenever he wants to without having to
enable <b>FEATURE_CANVAS</b>.
</p>
<p>
This way both the ogp module owner and Kurt will be happy. ogp doesn't
need to #ifdef <code>EncodeImagePNG</code> on both CANVAS_SUPPORT and
KURT_SUPPORT.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Why">
<h2>Why an API system when there are FEATURES and TWEAKS?</h2>

<p>
Features and tweaks work on the product level. Modules have needs to
export API's used by other modules where the product does not need to
be asked. The API system work between modules on the module
level. Product's may however find the need to import certain API's
from the core code, and are free to do so. Some utility code in core
may be exported as an API and the products can import it if they
like.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Where">
<h2>Where are the APIs described?</h2>

<p>
Each API is described as part of its definition in
the <code>module.export</code> file of the module that defines it.
</p>

<p>
The script that processes <a href="tweaks.html">tweaks</a> and APIs
and generates the various related header files also generates an XML
file containing the information in the <code>module.export</code>
files. This generated XML file is
named <code>modules/hardcore/documentation/apis.<em>version</em>.xml</code>
and uses an XSLT stylesheet to render in a semi-useful format.

</p>
<dl>
	<dt>API-owner</dt>
	<dd>
	  The API owner is the name of the developer responsible for
	  the API. If this value is set to "deprecated" it means the
	  API is no longer  available. The API cannot be imported by
	  any other modules, and an error will be produced if
	  tried. Mandatory.
	</dd>
	<dt>Description</dt>
	<dd>
	  Text describing the API. It must state clearly what the API
	  does and when it can and shall be imported. This description
	  will be read by both module owners and branch managers for
	  products. Can span several lines. Mandatory.
	</dd>
	<dt>Defines</dt>
	<dd>
	  A list of preprocessor defines separated by "," and/or

	</dd>
	<dt>Depends on</dt>
	<dd>
	  List of features/tweaks/defines/apis which this API depends
	  on. The features/tweaks/defines/apis must be turned on to be
	  able to import this API. If they are not and someone tries
	  to import the API, an error is produced. The items are
	  separated by "," and/or "and". "nothing" is a valid

	<dd>
	  List of tweaks and apis which cannot be tweaked/imported if

<p>
Example of an exported API:
</p>
<pre>
API_UTIL_ADVANCED_OPVECTOR			markus

	Enables an extended API to OpVector which allows
	Sort(), Search(), Add(), Subtract() and Intersect().

	Defines   : ADVANCED_OPVECTOR
	Depends on: nothing
</pre>
<p>
Here the util module exports the API <b>API_UTIL_ADVANCED_OPVECTOR</b>
which turns on the define <b>ADVANCED_OPVECTOR</b>. There are no
dependencies for this API, which means it can always be imported.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Syntax.import">
<h2>What is the format of module.import?</h2>

<pre>
API_MODULESHORT_NAME				Import-responsible

	Description of why the API is imported.

	<dd>
	  List of features/tweak/defines/apis which are required to be
	  turned on for the API to be imported. Several "Import
	  if"-lines can be used to describe an OR-condition for when
	  to import the API. Can be set to "always" if this API for
	  some reason always shall be imported. Mandatory.
	</dt>
</dl>
<p>
Example of API-import with several import-rules:<br>
</p>
<pre>
API_UTIL_ADVANCED_OPVECTOR			someone

	The advanced OpVector functions Sort() and Subtract() are used by search_engine.
	Ecmascript uses the advanced OpVector function Add().

	Import if: FEATURE_SEARCH_ENGINE, FEATURE_DISK
	Import if: FEATURE_ECMASCRIPT
</pre>
<p>
In the example, the preprocessor rule to when to include the API
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
#if (FEATURE_SEARCH_ENGINE == YES && FEATURE_DISK == YES) || FEATURE_ECMASCRIPT == YES
</pre>
<p>
The same effect can be created by duplicating the whole API-section
several times, like this:
</p>
<pre>
API_UTIL_ADVANCED_OPVECTOR			someone

	The advanced OpVector functions Sort() and Subtract() are used by search_engine.

	Import if: FEATURE_SEARCH_ENGINE, FEATURE_DISK

API_UTIL_ADVANCED_OPVECTOR			someone

	Ecmascript uses the advanced OpVector function Add().

	Import if: FEATURE_ECMASCRIPT
</pre>
<p>
The last method might sometimes be preferable since it makes it
possible to easier document the reason for the import and the owner
can be different.
</p>

<a name="mainline-configurations">
<h2>How do I change or introduce an API in different mainline configurations</h2>

<p>
The build-system can be told compile the "current" or "next" mainline
configuration. Each mainline configuration has an associated version
number. If the setup script finds the
file <code>module.export.<em>version</em></code>
or <code>module.import.<em>version</em></code>, it parses that file
instead of the <code>module.export</code>
or <code>module.import</code>. Thus an API can be added or changed for
only one mainline configuration.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to only keep the versiond
file <code>module.export.<em>version</em></code>
or <code>module.import.<em>version</em></code> for the "current"
mainline configuration and use the default file for the "next"
mainline configuration. Thus on switching the mainline version
numbers, the versioned file can be removed and only the not-versioned
file remains.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> If the "current" mainline version is 2.3 and the
"next" mainline version is 2.4, and one module needs to export
different APIs for the different mainline configurations, it can use
two files:
<dl>
  <dh><code>module.export.2.3</code></dh>
  <dd>exports all APIs for the "current" = 2.3 mainline
    configuration.</dd>
  <dh><code>module.export</code></dh><dd></dd>
  <dd>exports all APIs for the "next" = 2.4 mainline
    configuration.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
So if you want to add or change an API for the "next" mainline
configuration, look for the version number of the "current" mainline
configuration in <code>modules/hardcore/version.ini</code>. If the
file <code>module.export.<em>current_version</em></code> exists, you
can edit <code>module.export</code>.<br />
Otherwise copy <code>module.export</code>
to <code>module.export.<em>current_version</em></code>, add it to the
repository and modify <code>module.export</code>. Thus the "current"
mainline configuration remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
The same applies if you want to add or change an API for the "current"
mainline configuration: look for the version number of the "current"
mainline configuration
in <code>modules/hardcore/version.ini</code>. If the
file <code>module.export.<em>current_version</em></code> exists, you
can edit it<br />
Otherwise copy <code>module.export</code>
to <code>module.export.<em>current_version</em></code>, add it to the
repository and modify it. Thus the "next" mainline configuration
remains unchanged.
</p>

<a name="Import_new">
<h2>How do I import a new non-released API?</h2>

<p>
You may at some point want to release a version of your module that
uses some new API in another module, which has not yet been
introduced.
</p>
<p>
The easiest thing is to import the API as if it existed. It will
generate a warning from the script and the API will not be imported
until it has been exported.
</p>
</a>

<a name="Dependencies">
<h2>Can API's depend on each other?</h2>

<p>
You can <span style='color: red'>not</span> have circular
dependencies. If you have, it will be detected at compile time and
generate an error. If you find yourself in a situation that you might
need this, feel free to contact the module owner. Maybe we can
implement support for circular dependencies if there are good reasons
for it.
