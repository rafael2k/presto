<h1>Spatial navigation Module Memory Documentation</h1>

$Id$

<h2>Used OOM policies</h2>

Spatial navigation uses OP_STATUS internally.

<h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>

On OOM, spatial navigation methods return FALSE (failure).

<h2>Heap memory usage</h2>

Spatial navigation builds its own frame stack on the heap, otherwise no heap memory needed.

<h2>Stack memory usage</h2>

When moving into frames and iframes, some functions are used recursively, but that should not result in too much stack memory usage.

When traversing, the layout engine uses recursion, but spatial navigation traverse should not result in more stack memory usage than other traversals (such as on paint).

<h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>

Spatial navigation frees all its allocated memory when the window is destroyed.

<h2>Temp buffers</h2>

Temp buffers are not used.

<h2>Memory tuning</h2>

No tuning possible.

<h2>Tests</h2>

<h2>Coverage</h2>

<h2>Design choices</h2>

The main goals are the same as for Opera in general: correct, fast, low footprint and non-blocking.

<h2>Suggestions of improvements</h2>
