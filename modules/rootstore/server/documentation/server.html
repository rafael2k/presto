    <title>Rootstore server</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Extended Validation internal Logistics Bot (EViL-bot)</h1>

<h3>About the server</h3>

<p>The root store server is used to generate the files hosted by the certs.opera.com server. 
These files contain information about which Certificate Autority certificates are authorized 
as "pre-embedded" in Opera, as well as associated information, such as Extended Validation 
information and certificates that are to be deleted or marked untrusted.</p>

<p>To reduce the footprint of Opera's executable, as well as to increase the flexibility of 
Opera's rootstore and reduce the delay between accepting a root and when it becomes available 
to users, and need to ship new version with the new root(s), most of the roots are now (2008) 
to be hosted in a central repository, certs.opera.com</p>

<p>To reduce the attack surface for the system, it has the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All files being distributed are digitally signed by a RSA key that is at least 4096 bits long. 
This key should be at least as strong as the keys of the certificates it is signing. A client must
not accept a file from this system that does not verify.
<ul>
<li>TODO: Use Elliptic Curves Cryptography for the signtaure instead of RSA, as these will reduce the file footprint,
as well as the CPU cost of signing and verifying the files.</li>
<li>Rationale: We must do our best to prevent tampering with the files after they have been produced, and 
we need to protect ourselves against the possibility that the public servers are compromised.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The server will only be hosted on a TLS 1.0 (or later) server, using a 2048 bit RSA certificate, issued off 
a recognized EV root.<ul><li>TODO: Use Authenticated only ciphers for the TLS communication.</li><li>Rationale: 
Using a TLS server prevents replay attacks of old, but still valid files. Using an EV certificate is "necessary" 
because the server will host our information about authorized EV roots. Using Authenticated-only ciphers will 
increase the transparency of the data transfer, and as there is no sensitive data being transferred, encryption 
is not really needed, only authentication (it may also slightly reduce the CPU cost)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The production of the files should be performed on a server that is as separated from the network as 
is practically possible<ul><li>Rationale: To be able to update the files automatically, the production 
server must have direct unencrypted access to the signing keys; to reduce the likelyhood of a compromise 
of this server it must be as separated as possible from the network, even an intranet. While a physically 
and networkwise isolated machine would be ideal, this introduces a manual step into the process. A compromise 
solution is then to have a non-Ethernet connection, e.g. a serial cable, between the production server and 
a networked backend that forwards the files to the public servers.</li></ul></li>
<li>The files must only be valid for a certain period of time, preferably 2-4 weeks, but less than 6 months, 
and clients must not accept files that are not valid.
<ul><li>Rationale: A limited validity period reduces the possibility of replay attacks, e.g. through compromised 
TLS filtering proxies.</li></ul></li>
<li>The list of EV-oids must only be valid for a certain period of time, preferably 2-4 weeks, but less than 6 months, 
and less than the validity of the files, and clients must not accept files that are not valid. The validity period must 
also not extend past the date at which the CA will loose the EV status, and must be reduced to an absolute minimum during 
a grace period.
<ul><li>Rationale: A limited validity period reduces the possibility of replay attacks, e.g. through compromised 
TLS filtering proxies. EV OIDs are only valid for a limited period, depending on the result of an EV audit. Once the 
CA moves out of this period, they enter a grace period where the get some time to get back in compliance, but during 
this period information may become available that makes it necessary to remove the OIDs.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The above countermeasures are unable to counter these threats, and separate countermeasures
    that are out of scope for this document must be taken to counter them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compromised Opera executable where the signature check has been disabled</li>
    <li>Compromised CVS respository</li>
    <li>Renegade developers with CVS access</li>
    <li>Renedade employees with physical access the to the production server(s)</li>
    <li>Intruders that gain physical access to the production server(s)</li>

</ul>

<p>The current system is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A production server (the "backmost"-end) that produces and signs the files. This
    process is repeated every 6 hours.</li>
    <li>A backend that fetches the produced files from the "backmost"-end and forwards them
        to the public servers</li>
    <li>One or more public frontends, secured with TLS using 2048 bit RSA key. This part
        of the system must have enough capacity to serve all opera users at least once a
        week</li>
    <li>The Opera installation is coded to only open a single connection at a time to the
        frontends to reduce load on the server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of the system</h3>
<ul>

<li>A repository indexfile, listing all certificate files</li>
    <li>An entry for a certificate may indicate that the certificate must be updated</li>
    <li>An entry for a certficate may also indicate that another particular certificate
        is required when that certificate is installed. This is particularly useful to push
        EV releated roots, which are cross-signed by another root to make the chain acceptable
        to clients without the new root.</li>
    <li>The index may contain a list of certificates to be deleted.</li>
    <li>The index may contain a list of certficates that are untrusted and should be added
        to the list of untrusted certificates.</li>
    <li>Each certificate file will contain the data for one or more certificates, data includes
        name, the certificate and eventual EV information. If multiple certificates are
        included they are either certificates that have the same ID, or certificates that
        must be installed at the same time, due to the fact that they are either intermediates
        or associated EV roots.</li>
    <li>A list of roots that are authorized for EV, including the recogniozed EV-OIDs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Certificate IDs</h3>
    <p>
        A Certificate ID consists of a version number followed by the SHA-256 digest of
        identifying data from a certificate. Two or more different certificate IDs exist for each certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just the subject name (The client uses the issuer name)</li>
    <li>The subject name and the public key</li>
    <li>The subject name and an Authority &nbsp;key identifier.</li>
</ul>
    <p>
        This variation allows multiple ways of finding a certificate, depending on what
        data is available, e.g if the root is not available, the only thing you know is
        the issuer name and maybe the Authority Key Identifier. Just the subject name is
        not usually enough, as it is possible (but not recommended) that a certificate have
        the same name as another, and only the public keys are different.</p>
    <p>
        The version number may be one byte or longer. The current version number is 0x01.
        The version number identifies major changes in the fileformat and the signing key.
        any given version of Opera can only recognize and retrieve a single version.</p>
    <p>
        In filenames the Certificate ID is encoded in hexadecimal for with the version number
        hexencoded (uppercase letters) as a single block, followed immediately (without
        any spacing characters) by the SHA-256 digest result coded in blocks of two bytes
        (four hexadecimal digits) separated by "_" (underscore), and with ".xml" as the
        extension. E.g. 010203_0405_0607_0809_0A0B_0C0D_0E0F_1011_1213_1415_1617_1819_1A1B_1C1D_1E1F_2021.xml</p>
<h4>Version numbers</h4>
<dl>
<dt>0x01</dt>
<dd>Debug version, not to be used by final version, but may be used by Technology Preview
    and Alpha versions. Once a new version has been defined, this version must not be
    hosted on the public servers. The signing key is a 4096 bit RSA key stored in the
    rootstore module in the CVS repository. Signatures are encoded using PKCS #1.5</dd></dl>

    <dt>update-item</dt><dd>This certificate should be updated if the client have an old version of it. The value
    of the field specifies the expiration date of the new certificate, as a copy of the xpiration field from the certificate

    <dd>The certificate identified by this ID should be deleted if it was "pre-shipped". The

<h4>Certificate fields</h4>

<p>This subsection details the fields that can be used to represent a certificate and associated data.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Location</dt>
<dd>Inside a certificate encapsulating tag of a certificate file. See specific files.</dd>
<dt>Format</dt>
<dd><pre>&lt;issuer&gt;[text]&lt;/issuer&gt;
&lt;shortname&gt;[Text]&lt;/shortname&gt;
&lt;certificate-data&gt;[Base64 encoded data]&lt;/certificate-data&gt;

   &lt;ev-oid-entry&gt;[Object ID in numerical text form&lt;/ev-oid-entry&gt; 
&lt;/ev-oid-text&gt;
&lt;ev-oids&gt;[Base64 encoded data]&lt;/ev-oids&gt; </pre></dd>
    <dt>issuer</dt>
    <dd>This field contains the issuers name in a one-line format, e.g. "/C=JP/O=SECOM
        Trust.net/OU=Security Communication RootCA1", generated from the subject field of
        the certficate.</dd>
    <dt>shortname</dt>
    <dd>This optional field is a friendly name that
            can be used to identify the certificate in the UI if the default name is too long
            or not good enough.</dd>
    <dt>certificate-data</dt>
    <dd>This field contains the Base64
            encoded binary data of the certificate. Whitespace to break the date into multiple
            lines is permitted, and encouraged.</dd>
    <dt>ev-oid-text</dt>
    <dd>This is an optional
            list of the EV OIDs recognized for the certificate. It may contain one or more <em>ev-oid-entry</em>
    fields. The data are intended for human readers, to explain what is in the <em>ev-oids</em>
    field.</dd>
    <dt>ev-oid-entry</dt>
    <dd>This field contain a single EV Object ID (OID) displayed
            in the ASCII numerical form.</dd>
    <dt>ev-oids</dt>
    <dd>This field contains a sequence of EV-OIDs in DER format, followed by one or more signatures of the EV-OID sequence
            encapsulated in OCTET STRING objects. At least one signature must be generated by
            the key used to sign the containing file. TODO:
        Add expiration data.</dd></dl>

    <dt>certificates</dt><dd>This is the wrapper of one or more certificates, each
        indicated by a <em>certificate</em> tag.</dd><dt>certificate</dt><dd>This field contains
            a single certificate, as described in the certificate fields section. Any field
            may be used, but the sequence MUST contain at least the <em>certificate-data</em>
            tag. When processing this field the client must decode the certificate-data fields,
            and add it, optionally overriding an older version of the certificate, and register
            it in the appropriate authority or intermediate CA store with the shortname, warn
            and deny flags (if any). If there are any EV OIDs supporting clients must register
            them, provided they are valid, and remove registered EV OIDs if there are none in
            this list.</dd></dl>

                file, and issuer in the other is that trusted certificate is always an issuer, while
                in this case we are always dealing with a certificate issued to a subject.</dd><dt>untrusted-reason</dt><dd>This
                    is a short explanation for why the certificate is not trusted. The shortname should
