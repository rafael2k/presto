<h1>Module: Rootstore</h1>

<h2>About this module</h2>

<p>The rootstore module contains all the root certificates embedded in Opera as well
    as all relevant information, as well as the functionality needed to add these certificates
    to an installed Opera's repository.</p>

<p>There are two different modes for the the distribuition: A hardcoded list stored
   in the browser, and an optional remote storage hosted on the server certs.opera.com.
   The remote storage also contains the EV OID database. The serverside implementation
    is documented <a href="../server/documentation/server.html">here</a>, and the client side autoupdate functionality is maintained by
    the libssl module</p>

<h2>Interface overview and API documentation</h2>

<p>The primary API for the rootstore module is

<dl>

<dt>g_root_store_api 

<dd>This object is used to access the function(s) 
defined in the module for intializing the root certificate database of a 
SSL_Options object (See Libssl module for more information). 

</dl> 

<h2>Implementation description</h2>

<p>When called the initalization function processes a list of active 
certificates, verifies that the certificates are valid, then inserts them in the 
database with the associated flags.</p>

<p>When the database has already been initialized only certificates added after 
the database's version are added (provided thatthey are not already 
installed)</p>

<p>A part of the module will be used to produce online updates of the embedded roots, as well as data used to check Extended Validation certificates</p>


<h3>Footprint</h3>

<p>The module is fairly large due to the size of each certificate (usually 1 to 
3 KB, depending on the keysize and number of extensions in the certificate) 
embedded in the running executable. This size cannot be significantly reduced by 
compresion because the certificate contain encrypted (random) information.</p>

<h3>Dynamic memory use and OOM handling</h3>

<p>The module uses almost exclusively allocated memory in its operation, most of 
these have a relatively short lifespan. The structures with the longest 
timespans are the certificate items added to the database in the SSL_Options 
manager, and these are cleaned up when the object is destroyed.

<dl> 
<dt>OOM policies 

<dd><p>The database will not complete individual certificate embeddings that 
fail to allocate memory, but will try to complete as many as possiblem. This can 
result in incomplete databases</p>

<dt>Who handles OOM?

<dd><p>The module's code report some OOM situations as OP_STATUS indications, 
others are handled as gracefullay as possible</p>

<dt>Flow

<dd><p>The module has a single pass through main function. The rest are module 
object initialization/cleanup code</p>

<dt>Heap memory usage
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Temporary storage of certificate
<li>"Permanent" storage of certificates in the SSL_Option manager in the libssl module
</ul>

<dt>Stack memory usage

<dd><p>The module uses little stack space, but may create various temporary 
vectors and dataprocessing objects, which may exceed 200 bytes.</p>

<dt>Static memory usage

<dd><p>There is a single large hardcoded table, the root certificate array in defcert.cpp (via rootstore-table.h), which 
probably exceeds 80 KB. This may be duplicated by the selftest</p>

<p>On some platforms this array may be implemented as an allocated array with runtime initialization, but the array is deleted immediately after use.</p>

<dt>Freeing memory on exit
<dd><p>The allocated global API object is destroyed by the module destruction.</p>

<dt>Temp buffers
<dd><p>No temporary buffers are used</p>

<dt>Memory tuning
<dd><p>It is not possible to tune the module's memory usage.</p>

<dt>Tests
<dd><p>Selftests</p>

<dt>Coverage
<dd><p>Selftest, or open the SSL preferences on a new installation.</p>

<dt>Design choices
<dd><p>The certificates are stored internally in the executable.</p>

<dt>Improvements

<dd><p>Most or all of the database can be moved to a remote download location 
reducing the executable size considerably. Work on this is underway.</p>
