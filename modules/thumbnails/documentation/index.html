<h1>Thumbnails module</h1>
<p id="toc"></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>The thumbnails module is a framework for generating and caching thumbnails.</p>
 <a href="https://wiki.oslo.opera.com/developerwiki/Modules/thumbnails">Thumbnails wiki page</a>
<h2>Interface Overview</h2>
 <h3>API documentation</h3>
  Doxygen <a href="api/index.html">documentation</a>.
 <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
   Most of the public API of the thumbnails module is exported through the 
   <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a> class which is accessible
   from the global object <code>g_thumbnail_manager</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are currently three different modes of thumbnail generation. This is specified by
   using the <a href="api/classOpThumbnail.html">OpThumbnail</a>::ThumbnailMode
   values.
  </p>
    
<h2>Use cases</h2>
 <h3>Generating thumbnails from window</h3>
  <p>
   Use <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::GetThumbnailForWindow() to generate
   a thumbnail from an already opened window. 
  </p>
 <h3>Generating thumbnails from a URL</h3>
  <p>
   When generating thumbnails for e.g. speed dial you don't always have a window and a document ready screen
   shot. In those cases you can instruct the thumbnails module to generate a thumbnail from any given URL.
   This is a significantly heavier and more complex operation than just screenshotting an open window.
  </p>
  <p>
   First of all you need to setup a listener to retrieve the thumbnail when it has been generated. Implement
   the <a href="api/classThumbnailManagerListener.html">ThumbnailManagerListener</a> interface and add it with
   <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::AddListener().
  </p>
  <p>
   Use <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::RequestThumbnail() to request a thumbnail
   to be generated. The URL will be loaded in the background, when the loading is finished a thumbnail will
   be generated and announced through the ThumbnailManagerListener.
  </p>
  <p>
   To avoid having to regenerate all thumbnail everytime they are needed there is a built in cache. 
   <code>RequestThumbnail()</code> will automatically return thumbnail from the cache if possible. To keep track of
   which thumbnail to keep in cache the URL's are reference counted. Use
   <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::AddThumbnailRef() and 
   <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::DelThumbnailRef() to increase and
   decrease the counter.
  </p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
...
<h2 id="tweaking">Tweaking performance and memory usage</h2>

Thumbnail generation can be a heavy operation. Both in terms of memory and cpu time. There
are however a couple ways of tweaking this to fit the capabilities of the platform.

<h3>Tweaks</h3>
<p>
 Descriptions of tweaks that can be used to tweak performance and memory usage. For a full list
 see module.tweaks.
</p>

<h4>TWEAK_THUMBNAILS_SEQUENTIAL_GENERATE</h4>
<p>
 By default the thumbnail manager handles all requests in parallell. If this tweak is enabled
 the request will be handled on by one.
</p>
<p>
 Syncing nine speed dials to a clean profile would for example cause nine documents to load
 in parallell in the background with the performance and memory consumptions that imply. If
 this sounds like a bad idea on your platforms you want to enable this.
</p>

<h4>TWEAK_THUMBNAILS_MAX_CACHED_IMAGES</h4>
<p>
 Generated thumbnail are stored in a disk cache. To limit the amount of disk used you can
 set this tweak.
</p>

<h3>Thumbnail modes</h3>
<p>
 There are currently three different thumbnail modes and they have different impact on
 memory usage. See <a href="api/classOpThumbnail.html">OpThumbnail</a>::ThumbnailMode.
</p>
<p>
 <code>Viewport</code> is the standard mode. A screenshot of the whole viewport is taken
 and scaled down. This mode also has the highest impact on heap memory usage since a big
 bitmap, size of the viewport, is needed for the intermediate storage of the screen.
</p>
<p>
 <code>ViewportLowQuality</code> is a low quality version of <code>ViewPort</code>. It paints
 a scaled version of the viewport directly to the thumbnail which eliminates the need for
 intermediate storage. This greatly reduces peak heap usage but may on the other hand result
 in poor thumbnail image quality. This is largely dependent on the painters ability to paint
 scaled views.
</p>
<p>
 The third mode is <code>FindLogo</code> where the thumbnail manager tries to generate a
 (non-scaled) thumbnail of a logo image in the document.
 

<h2>Memory usage</h2>
<h3>Used OOM policies</h3>
<p>
 External API's returns OpStatus::ERR_NO_MEMORY or NULL pointers on OOM.
</p>
<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>
<p>
 The thumbnails module will typically fail to generate a thumbnail on OOM and report this to the caller.
 The caller is responsible for having an appropriate fallback behavior. The module will deal with any
 necessary internal clean up.
</p>
<h3>Description of flow</h3>
 ...
<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>
<p>
 The thumbnails module has a potentially big heap usage; both directly by using big buffers to render
 the thumbnail and indirectly by loading pages in the background. See the tweaks section on how to
 limit the heap usage.
<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>
<p>There are no recursive calls in thumbnail and stack usage is small in general.</p>

<h3>Static memory usage</h3>
<p>Small.</p>

<h3>Caching and freeing memory</h3>
 <p>
  Use <a href="api/classThumbnailManager.html">ThumbnailManager</a>::Purge() to clean up
  the memory cache.
 </p>
<h3>Freeing memory on exit</h3>
<p>
 All allocated memory is deallocated by the ThumbnailManager when the module is destroyed.
<h3>Temp buffers</h3>
<p>No temp buffers are used.</p>

<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
<p>See the <a href="#tweaking">Tweaking performance and memory usage</a> sections.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
 <p>There are currently no test regarding memory usage</p>
<h3>Coverage</h3>
 ...
<h3>Design choices</h3>
 ...
<h3>Suggestions of improvements</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Having a painter that can reliably paint scaled down views with high quality would
     greatly reduce the memory impacts of thumbnail generation. (VegaOpPainter?)
