 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  The <em>Preferences module</em> provides support for reading the
  configuration from disk and writing updates back.
  The list of preferences supported are defined by the
  <a href="prefssystem.html">preferences system</a>.
  The low-level file format support is provided by the
  <a href="../../prefsfile/documentation/index.html">Prefsfile module</a>.

 <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
 <h4 id="prefsframework">Preferences framework</h4>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classPrefsManager.html">PrefsManager</a> is implemented
  as <a href="api/index.html#PrefsManager">a framework</a>
  for handling preferences.
  The PrefsManager class itself is seldom called, except for setup and exit
  operations, when using the string based preferences APIs (if enabled)
  and to commit changes to storage.
 </p>
 <p>
  It interacts with the
  <a href="../../prefsfile/documentation/index.html">Prefsfile module</a>
  to store them, normally on disk using the PrefsFile class, but other
  solutions are possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classPrefsNotifier.html">PrefsNotifier</a> is used for
  communicating changes in run-time configured default values to the
  preferences framework. When the client detects a change in one of these
  preferences, it calls the appropriate method on the global PrefsNotifier
  object, which will then handle any reconfiguration needed inside of the
  core.
 </p>
 <p>
  The preferences themselves are
  <a href="api/index.html#opprefscollection">stored and managed</a> by
  sub-classes of
  <a href="api/classOpPrefsCollection.html">OpPrefsCollection</a>.
  They also provide
  <a href="api/classOpPrefsListener.html">OpPrefsListener</a> objects,
  which provides a method for registering objects to listen to changes in
  certain OpPrefsCollection objects.
  The preferences inside each collection is defined using the
  <a href="prefssystem.html">preferences system</a>, with a few exceptions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The partitioning into collection objects reflects the modularised
  state of the Opera core, in such that the different settings
  can be owned by the code modules
  that are using them, and that build configurations that exclude certain
  code modules also should exclude the associated preference settings.
  The collections hold preferences for a given module, or for a set of
  tightly related modules (for instance PrefsCollectionJS contains JavaScript
  and <acronym title="Document object model">DOM</acronym> settings).
  Since collections are meant to be owned by their respective module, all
  the preferences relevant only to the module/module set, and only those,
  should be located in the respective collection class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some shared preferences without a clear owner will still reside in the
  preference module, as will the special files collection.
  The files collections also handles directory related settings in
  collaboration with OpFolderManager (it does not retain the directory
  settings itself, but relies on OpFolderManager doing so).
 </p>
 <p>
  To handle the possibility of overriding settings on a host basis,
  OpPrefsCollectionWithHostOverride (a subclass of
  <a href="api/classOpPrefsCollection.html">OpPrefsCollection</a>, and the
  superclass of all collections supporting host overrides) holds a list of
  overridden settings.
  Changes in overrides are broadcast to the listeners using the
  <code>BroadcastOverride()</code> callback.
 </p>
 <p>
  See the <a href="api/hierarchy.html">class hierarchy</a> for details on
  the different classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The scope for PrefsManager and its associated objects is the settings
  read and written to the standard preference file (often called
  <code>opera.ini</code> or <code>opera6.ini</code>).
  There are a few minor exceptions to this, but the basic rule is thatif
  the setting is <strong>not</strong> in the main preference file, it does
  <strong>not</strong> belong to the preference manager and the preference
  collections.
 </p>

 <h4 id="prefsutils">Utility code</h4>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classOperaConfig.html#">OperaConfig</a> class assists the
  <a href="../../url/documentation/index.html">URL code</a> in generating
  HTML and JavaScript code for the
  <a href="opera:config">opera:config</a> document, which allows configuring
  of Opera from a document view, using JavaScript and
  <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> interfaces.
  It does so by using the framework from the
  <a href="../../about/documentation/index.html">About module</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classPrefsUpgrade.html">PrefsUpgrade</a> class is used to
  support upgrading from previous versions of the preferences system.
  It will only be included if the appropriate feature definition is enabled,
  and will check a special version flag in the ini file to see if it should
  upgrade it to a newer version or not.
  <a href="changes.html">Information about changes that have been made to the
  preferences compared to previous versions is available in a separate
  document</a>.
 </p>

 <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
 <p>
  There is also an automatically generated
  <a href="settings.html">list of settings</a>
  that is built automatically when the
  <a href="prefssystem.html">preferences system</a>
  is updated.
  It can also be built by running the
  <code>extract-documentation.pl</code> script from the top-level directory
  of this module.
 </p>

 <h2 id="usecases">Use-cases</h2>
 <h3 id="settingupthemainoperapreferences">Setting up main Opera preferences</h3>
 <p>
  The settings are read during the prefs module initialisation phase.
  In its initialisation code, the platform creates an instance of the
  <a href="../../prefsfile/documentation/index.html#apidocumentation">PrefsFile</a> class
  representing its preferences file(s) and saves this in the
  <code>OperaInitInfo</code>.
  This object will be taken over and used when the
  <a href="api/classPrefsManager.html">PrefsManager</a> is initialised.
 </p>

 <h3 id="accessingasinglepreference">Accessing a single preference</h3>
 <p>
  To read a preference, the code calls the global instance of the
  preference collection object holding the preference directly, for most
  collections this is done via the <code>GetIntegerPref()</code> and
  <code>GetStringPref()</code> methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Conversely, settings are stored using the <code>WriteIntegerL()</code> and
  <code>WriteStringL()</code> methods.
 </p>

 <h3 id="usingthestringbasedapi">Using the string based API</h3>
 <p>
  If the string based API has been enabled, it is possible to access most
  settings with the names as used in the <code>INI</code> file, by calling
  the <code>PrefsManager::GetPreferenceL()</code> method.
 </p>

 <h3 id="listeningtochanges">Listening to changes</h3>
 <p>
  Code that wants to listen to changes in relevant settings inherit the
  <code>OpPrefsListener</code> interface (or
  <code>PrefsCollectionFilesListener</code> for file preferences) and
  implement the <code>PrefChanged()</code> method.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example: The URL code listening to changes in the disk cache size.
 </p>
 <pre>
 <b>void</b> URLManager::PrefChanged(<b>enum OpPrefsCollection::Collections</b> id,
                              <b>int</b> pref, <b>int</b> newvalue)
 {
   <b>switch</b> (id)
   {
   <b>case</b> OpPrefsCollection::Network:
     <b>switch</b> ((<b>enum</b> PrefsCollectionNetwork::integerpref) pref)
     {
     <b>case</b> DiskCacheSize:
       m_cachesize = newvalue;
       <b>break</b>;
     }
   <b>default</b>:
     OP_ASSERT(FALSE); // I should not be hearing this
   }
 }</pre>

 <h3 id="notifyingchanges">Notifying changes</h3>
 <p>
  Code that wants to notify that the platform default settings have changed
  call the appropriate <code>PrefsNotifier</code> interface.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example: The platform has detected that the user has moved to a different
  access point or network and that the proxy settings have changed.
 </p>
 <pre>
 <b>void</b> PlatformProxyObserver::OnChange()
 {
  TRAPD(rc, PrefsNotifier::OnProxyChangedL());
  <b>if</b> (OpStatus::IsMemoryError(rc))
  {
   g_memory_manager-&gt;RaiseError(rc);
  }
 }</pre>

 <h3 id="addinganewpreference">Adding a new preference</h3>
 <p>
  New preferences should go in the collection object owned by/most
  closely related to the module where the preference is used.
  The exceptions to this are font, color and file preferences which
  are handled by special collections.
 </p>
 <p>
  The preferences are defined in a text files, which are used to generate
  source code.
  <a href="prefssystem.html#addinganewpreference">More details</a> are available
  in the <a href="prefssystem.html">documentation for the preference system</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  There should usually be no need to do alter the interface beyond this,
  but in some rare cases a specialised interface may be needed.
  Please see the
  <a href="api/classOpPrefsCollection.html">API documentation</a> for further
  information about how to do that.
 </p>

 <h4 id="addingnewpreferenceoutside">Collections outside the prefs module</h4>
 <p>
  The same scripts are used for preference collections stored outside
  the prefs module.
  As long as the collections are listed in a <code>module.prefs</code> file
  as described in the
  <a href="prefssystem.html">preference system documentation</a>, the core
  build setup scripts should take care of everything for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  For an active example of preference collections outside the prefs module
  using this system, look at the coregogi preferences in
  <code>platforms/core</code> in a regular coregogi checkout.
 </p>
 <p>
  See also the
  <a href="prefssystem.html#addinganewcollection">preference system guide to
  adding a new collection</a>.
 </p>

 <h3 id="readonlyandfileless">Read-only and file-less operation</h3>
 <p>
  For products with special requirements, it is possible to run the preferences
  system without preference files, with read-only preference files, or with
  fixed preferences.
  This is controlled by two features, <code>FEATURE_PREFS_READ</code> and
  <code>FEATURE_PREFS_WRITE</code>, and works as described in the following
  table.
 </p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th colspan="2" rowspan="2">Â <th colspan="2">FEATURE_PREFS_READ
  <tr>
   <th>YES<th>NO
  <tr>
   <th rowspan="2">FEA&shy;TURE_&shy;PREFS_&shy;WRITE
   <th>YES
   <td class="odd">
    <strong>Normal operation.</strong>
    The preference file(s) are read from and the user preferences file is
    written to when you perform a Write call.
   <td class="even">
    <strong>Memory-only operation.</strong>
    All preferences will be initialised with their default values, and changes
    written using the write APIs will be retained until the end of the session.
    Use this if you want to run without any preference file at all.
  <tr>
   <th>NO
   <td class="even">
    <strong>Read-only operation.</strong>
    Preferences will be read as usual from the preference file(s), but they
    will never be written back.
    This mode can be useful when running from a read-only file system, when
    you still want the customer to be able to customise settings without having
    to recompile.
   <td class="odd">
    <strong>Static operation.</strong>
    No preference file(s) are read and all settings are initialised with their
    default values.
    No settings can be changed at run-time.

 <h3 id="generalisationandreimplementation">Generalisation and re-implementation</h3>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classOpPrefsCollection.html">OpPrefsCollection</a>
  class is written so that it is easy to create new preferences sets for
  new code.
  Having them divided into several collection objects like this also
  helps hiding irrelevant settings from builds not sporting the code where
  they are used, and makes it possible to store the objects in the code
  modules where the preferences are referenced, meaning that the prefs
  module can be released asynchronously from the other modules.
 </p>

 <h3 id="memorymanagement">Memory management</h3>
 <h4 id="heapusage">Heap usage</h4>
 <p>
  All of the preferences collections will allocate their internal data
  structures on the heap, using arrays whose size is relative to the
  number of preferences.
 </p>

 <h4 id="stackusage">Stack usage</h4>
 <p>
  There are no recursive calls.
 </p>

 <h4 id="staticmemoryusage">Static memory usage</h4>
 <p>
  There are several global pointers, one to the <code>PrefsManager</code>
  object and one each for the <code>OpPrefsCollection</code> subclasses.
 </p>

 <h4 id="oompolicies"><abbr title="Out of memory">OOM</abbr> policies</h4>
 <p>
  The vast majority of functions that require memory to be allocated is
  using the <code>TRAP</code>/<code>LEAVE</code> convention.
  This approach was selected since the calls are mostly low-level and
  thus needs its caller to do any necessary clean-up that would free
  memory.
 </p>

 <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
 <p>
  Enabling host overrides will mean that lookups for the preferences that
  are overridable will be slower, as the preferences code must scan through
  all the overridden hosts to find an override, if present.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="#usingthestringbasedapi">Using the string based API</a> is slow
  as it requires a linear scan through the preferences to find a match.
  It should be restricted to where it is unavoidable, such as responding to
  external data, such as downloaded preferences or interfaces to outside
  code.
 </p>
