MSG_PREFS_RECONFIGURE			peter

	Start the part of the prefs module initialization that is run after
	the Opera core has been initialized and the message queue started.
	This is used to avoid dependencies to other modules in the prefs
	initialization code, since prefs must be initialized very early on
	in Opera.

	Only ever used internally, code outside the prefs module should never
	send this message, it is posted when you perform the Opera::InitL()
	call.

	Depends on: nothing
