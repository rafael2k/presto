 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  "XML names" are the names of elements and attributes in XML
  documents.  They can be represented in a couple of different ways:
 </p>

 <dl>
  <dt>Qualified name</dt>

  <dd>
   A qualified name is a single string that matches either of the
   productions
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName">NCName</a>
   or
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">QName</a>
   from the
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a>
   specification (or the corresponding productions from the
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/">Namespaces in XML 1.1</a>

   specification.)  A qualified name needs to be used together with
   additional namespace information.
  </dd>

  <dt>Expanded name</dt>

  <dd>
   An expanded name is two strings; the
     <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-LocalPart">local part</a>
   of a qualified name and a namespace URI.  The term "expanded name"
   is commonly used in various specifications to describe such a
   representation of a name.
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="complete-name">Complete name</a></dt>

  <dd>
    A complete name is an extension to the expanded name that adds a
    third string; the prefix used in the qualified name.
  </dd>
 </dl>

 <h2>Usage</h2>
 <p>
  The "qualified name" form is mostly only used while parsing (either
  while parsing the XML source or while handling attributes whose
  values are qualified names.)  Since it doesn't contain enough
  information to have any real meaning, it shouldn't be used directly.
  In particular: <b>one should never assume that a namespace prefix
  has any particular meaning unless that namespace prefix has been
  declared</b> (the namespace prefixes
    <code>xml</code>
  and
    <code>xmlns</code>
  are of course exempt from this rule, they always have the same
  meaning.
 </p>

 <p>
  The "expanded name" form should be used when only the meaning of the
  name is interesting, not how it was expressed in the XML source.
  This is usually the case when one parses XML.
 </p>

 <p>
  The "complete name" form should be used when both the meaning of the
  name and how it was expressed in the XML source is interesting.
  Examples of when this is the case are when parsing documents that
  will be accessible from DOM (the prefix must be known in order to
  implement the property Node.prefix) and when parsing XSLT (literal
  result elements, when instantiated, will be created with the same
  prefix as was used in the XSLT stylesheet source.)
 <p>

 <h2>Classes</h2>
 <p>
  Four classes are used to represent expanded names and complete
  names:
    <a href="api/classXMLExpandedName.html">XMLExpandedName</a>,
    <a href="api/classXMLExpandedNameN.html">XMLExpandedNameN</a>,
    <a href="api/classXMLCompleteName.html">XMLCompleteName</a>
  and
    <a href="api/classXMLCompleteNameN.html">XMLCompleteNameN</a>.
  The classes XMLExpandedName and XMLCompleteName deal with
  null-terminated strings and can optionally own the string values
  while the classes XMLExpandedNameN and XMLCompleteNameN deal with
  unterminated strings with explicit length.
 </p>

 <p>
  The N-versions are useful since they can be constructed from a
  qualified name without memory allocation or copying.  To create a
  null-terminated version of the name one can first create an explicit
  length version from a qualified name and then initialize the
  null-terminated version from it.  When constructing expanded or
  complete names from qualified names one of course need to resolve
  prefixes into namespace URIs using the namespace declarations in
  scope.  See the
    <a href="namespaces.html">XML namespaces</a>
  document for more details on how to do that.
