 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  The XML Utils module provides code for handling XML namespace
  declarations through the class
    <a href="api/classXMLNamespaceDeclaration.html">XMLNamespaceDeclaration</a>.
  This includes handling XML namespace declaration attributes,
  maintaining a list of namespace declarations in scope and
  "resolving"
    <a href="names.html#complete-name">complete names</a> by
  setting the URI component based on the value of the prefix component
  and a list of namespace declarations in scope.
 </p>

 <h2>Scope list representation</h2>
 <p>
  The list of namespace declarations in scope is represented as a
  linked list of XMLNamespaceDeclaration objects via a pointer to the
  object representing the most recent (nearest) namespace declaration.
  A null pointer represents an empty list.  The objects are reference
  counted.  Each object owns a reference to the previous namespace
  declaration and external users typically owns a single reference to
  the head of the list.
 </p>

 <p>
  The list is maintained while parsing/processing an XML document by
  pushing and popping objects as namespaces are declared and go out of
  scope.  By adding an extra reference to the current head of the list
  at any point, users can essentially keep a copy of the list of
  namespace declarations in scope at that point indefinitely while
  parsing/processing continues and the list changes.
 </p>

 <h2>Pushing namespace declarations</h2>
 <p>
  The list of namespace declarations in scope is updated from new
  namespace declaration attributes by calling the static function
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::ProcessAttribute</code>.
  It is perfectly legal to call the function to process attributes
  that are not namespace declaration attributes.  If called to process
  such attributes, it will do nothing at all.
 </p>

 <p>
  The scope of namespace declarations is determined by the
   <code>level</code>
  argument to
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::ProcessAttribute</code>.
  The level of an attribute is typically the number of ancestors the
  element on which the attribute was specified.  Users are however
  free to use other methods to determine the level of an attribute and
  thus implement different scoping rules, if appropriate.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition from being pushed when processing namespace declaration
  attributes, namespace declarations can be pushed manually using one
  of the static functions
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Push</code>
  or
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::PushL</code>.
  These functions work much the same way as
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::ProcessAttribute</code>
  except instead of an attribute name and value, a namespace URI and
  prefix is supplied together with the pointer to the head of the
  namespace declaration list to update and the level of the namespace
  declaration.
 </p>

 <p>
  The first argument to each of the functions used to push namespace
  declarations is a pointer to the currently most recent namespace
  declaration object.  This pointer is updated by the functions if a
  new namespace declaration is pushed to point to the new namespace
  declaration.  One reference to the previous namespace declaration
  object, which the caller is assumed to own, is transferred to the
  new namespace declaration object.  If the pointer was initially null
  the caller did not own a reference to any namespace declaration
  object, but will own one after the function call.
 </p>

 <h2>End of scope</h2>
 <p>
  The end of the scope of namespace declarations is signalled by
  calling the static function
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>
  with the same
    <code>level</code>

  argument as was used to process the namespace declaration argument
  or to push the declaration.  Normally, the scope of namespace
  declarations end when the element on which the corresponding
  namespace declaration attribute was specified ends, so typically 
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>
  should be called at the end of each element, with the same
    <code>level</code>
  argument as was used to process that element's attributes.  It is
  okay to call 
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>
  at the end of any element, even though no namespace declaration's
  scope ends there.
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>
  will simply pop any namespace declaration that was pushed with a
  equal or higher
    <code>level</code>
  argument than that used in the call to 
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Like to the functions used to push namespace declarations, the first
  argument to the function
    <code>XMLNamespaceDeclaration::Pop</code>
  is a pointer to the object representing the currently most recent
  namespace declaration.  This pointer is updated if any namespace
  declarations are popped, and one reference to the object, which the
  caller is assumed to own, is transferred to the object the pointer
  points to after the function call.  If the last namespace
  declaration is popped, the pointer is set to null and the reference
  is simply released.
 </p>

 <p>
  Note: if the list of namespaces in scope is only modified by calls
  to the pushing and popping functions described here, no explicit
  reference counting will be necessary, unless processing is stopped
  before all levels are popped (that is, when the list of namespaces
  in scope is potentially non-empty.)  If processing is so stopped,
  only a single reference needs to be released.
