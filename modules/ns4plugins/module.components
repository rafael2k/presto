COMPONENT_PLUGIN						terjes

	The plug-in component loads and interacts with platform plug-in
	libraries on behalf of the ns4plugins module.

	A plug-in component interacting with a plug-in library is locked
	to that specific library. Separate libraries are handled by
	utilizing separate plug-in components.
