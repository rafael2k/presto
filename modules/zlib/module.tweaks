TWEAK_ZLIB_REDUCE_FOOTPRINT				wonko

	If enabled, the footprint of zlib will be reduced. this is
	done by reducing the functionality (no adler32_combine and
	crc32_combine, no dictionary support etc) and speed (less loop
	unwinding, no fast and stored versions of deflate - only slow,
	compute crc:s one byte at the time etc).

	Category: setting
	Define: ZLIB_REDUCE_FOOTPRINT
	Depends on: FEATURE_3P_ZLIB
	Enabled for: minimal
	Disabled for: desktop, smartphone, tv, mini
