<h1>History Module</h1>
<p>
The History Module currently consists of the History Model and the Direct
History. The History Model (formerly known as Global History) represents
the browsing history and not the session history. It is used (on desktop) for
the history panel/page, auto completion in the URL field, Top Ten and
more. Direct History is typed history, and is displayed on desktop when
pressing the down arrow on the URL field without having typed anything.
</p>
<p>
The policies of these histories differ in that Direct History stores what was
user typed, with no regard to whether the typed string resolved to a URL and
the History Model should only store valid URLs, that is a string should only be
inserted after it is known to resolve.
</p>
<p>
These policies are only partially enforced by the histories themselves. Mostly
a string is supplied and will be inserted, no check is made that it actually
does resolve (though this required by the History Model policy). However, the
History Model does enforce one policy that will be discussed below.  
</p>
<body>

<h1>History Model</h1>
<p>
The History Model will be referred to as the Core History Model and History
Model interchangeably, though it should not be confused with the History Model
that resides in adjunct (a model built on top of the Core History Model). 
</p>
<p>
The Core History Models main purpose is to store URLs and the last time they
were accessed. This is stored in items called Core History Model Pages. Note
that it only stores one copy of each URL and the last time it was accessed. To
maintain a popularity needed for something like Top Ten an additional field is
also maintained - average interval. This field is calculated based on its
former value and the time passed since last access. For more information on the 
Core History Model Items see their section below.
</p>
<p>
There is also a set of folders to support different views of history. Currently
there are four kinds of folders - Prefix Folder, Site Folder, Sub Site Folder
and Time Folder. These are described further below.
</p>
<p>
The Core History Model Items are referenced from two different structures to
maintain the two supported views of history - time and site. 
</p>

<p>
The time view is supported by a vector where the items are maintained in
chronological order based on the last time they were accessed. This is also the
order maintained in the global.dat file (although there the order is reversed
for legacy reasons). 
</p>

<p>
The second structure is a Lexiographic Splay Tree. This tree was designed to
store URLS and to provide a convenient structure for auto completion. The Lex
Splay Tree will be further described below. What is important to note is that
this structure was chosen to provide searches in time proportional to the
length of the URL and not the number of items in history, and secondly that the
URLs are stored in alphabetical order.  
</p>

<h2>API</h2>

<p>The diagram bellow shows the general structure of this module. See
<a href="api/index.html">doxygen generated documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3>class HistoryModel</h3>

The Core History Model is implemented as a singleton. This means that there is
only one Core History Model at any given time. This model is pointed to by the
global variable g_globalHistory (also called globalHistory).

<h4>class Listener</h4>
<p>
The Core History Model supports a listener mechanism that currently only
supports one listener, though should in the future support more. This mechanism
is the recommended interface to any external client code that intends to
display a view of the Core History Model. This listener layer provides the
upcalls necessary to broadcast changes in the model.
</p>

<p>
"opera:history", however, uses a different (not recommended) mechanism. This
mechanism is supported but will hopefully disappear in the future, and should
be considered depricated.
</p>

<h3>class HistoryItem</h3>

<p>
Core History Model Item is the base class for all pages and folders in the model. 
</p>

<h3>class HistoryPage</h3>
<p>
Objects of this class represent the basic element in the Core History
Model. They store the URL, title, last access and average interval of a
specific URL. These items are the only items present in the time sorted
vector. 
</p>

<h3>class HistoryFolder</h3>

<p>
Core History Model Folder is the base class for all folders in the model. 
</p>

<h4>class HistorySiteFolder</h4>
<p>
Folder representing a Site. Stored in the "stripped tree".
</p>

<h4>class HistorySiteSubFolder</h4>
<p>
Folder representing a Site in a specific time period. There are five such
folders contained in each site folder (actually the number of folders is
NUM_TIME_PERIODS which currently is five - see history_enums.h).
</p>

<h4>class HistoryTimeFolder</h4>
<p>
Folder representing a specific time period. There are NUM_TIME_PERIODS number
of time folders.
</p>

<h4>HistoryPrefixFolder</h4>
<p>
Folder representing a specific prefix. There are as many such folders as there
are supported prefixes - see history_prefixes.cpp.
</p>


<h3>class LexSplayTree</h3>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/splay.pdf">"Self-adjusting binary search trees"</a>
for more information about Lexiographic Splay trees.
</p>

<p>
The History Model currently uses the templated version of the LexSplayTree
called OpSplayTree. The tree is tail compressed and use keys that are assumed
to be memoryvise managed outside of the tree and they are also assumed to be
shared. Meaning the tree will assume that two items inserted with identical
keys are actually inserted with the _same_ key.
</p>

<h2>File formats</h2>

<p>
See description of the <a href="file_format.html">file formats</a> used by Core
History Model.
</p>

<h2>Memory usage</h2>

<h3>Used OOM policies</h3>

<p>
All methods in the external API which can cause an error will return an
OP_STATUS which should be checked for ERR_NO_MEMORY and ERR. A few internal
methods use TRAP/LEAVE, but this should be invisible to the external API.
</p>

<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>
<p>
The History Model passes the OOM error to the caller.
</p>

<h3>Description of flow</h3>
<p>
The general flow in the module is simple: An item is inserted and can can be
retrieved individually or in an autocompletion call.
</p>

<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>
All History Model Items are allocated in heap memory. The number of such items
is limited by the product pref PrefsCollectionCore::MaxGlobalHistory which
indicates the maximum number of elements. The urls of the items are indexed in
the Lexiographic Splay Tree called stripped. This tree is also heap
allocated. The tree is tail compressed and and all common prefixes are shared
so the overhead is limited.
</p>
<p>
The url strings themselves are shared since they are Core History Model Keys
combined with Prefixes. Meaning that http://www.opera.com and
ftp://ftp.opera.com share the key "opera.com" and have two different
prefixes. These keys are also used in the tail compressed tree - so the
overhead of the tree is limited to the unique prefixes.
</p>
<p>
The total approximate size of a HistoryPage item on a 32-bit unix is 44
bytes. It has pointers to a HistorySiteFolder, a
HistoryPrefixFolder and a HistoryKey which are also allocated by the
module but are shared across items. The titles are item specific and can be up
to MAX_URL_LEN (4096 bytes). The same length restraint applies to the url
though here the prefix of the url is indicated by the prefix folder and the
rest of the url is given by the key which is shared among items with the same
"stripped" url. "http://www.opera.com" has "http://www." as it's prefix and
"opera.com" as its "stripped" url.

<!--
Approximate worst case :

all titles = 4096
all urls   = 4096

all urls are different
total number of keys = total number of items

item = 44 + 4096 + 4096

max number of items on desktop : 10000

approximate size = 10.000 * 10.000 = 100.000.000 bytes
-->

<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>
There is very limited stack use except for some recursive traversing of the
Lexiographic Splay Tree, since the tree is tail compressed the depth is
typically not that high (between 8 and 30) but worst case it can be 4096.
</p>

<h3>Static memory usage</h3>
<p>
There is only one global variable for the HistoryModel : g_globalHistory
</p>

<h3>Caching and freeing memory</h3>

<p>
There are no caches. Most of the memory used will be freed if DeleteAllItems()
is called - this will however also empty the global.dat file.
</p>

<h3>Freeing memory on exit</h3>
<p>
All the memory is freed when the History Model is deleted.
</p>

<h3>Temp buffers</h3>
<p>
The module does not use the tempbuffers from the memory manager.
</p>

<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
<p>
Currently there is no way to tune the memory usage other than to reduce the
number of items allowed in history - this can be done runtime by calling the
Size function with the new maximum number of items.
</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
There are no specific memory tests for this module.
</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>
Creating the History Model and reading in a global.dat file will test most
memory allocations.
</p>

<h3>Design choices</h3>
<p>
In the current design the items are referred to by either/both a vector (which
may have a sorting) and the lexiogaphic splay tree. The tree facilitates fast
searching, alphabetical sorting and gouping of pages on a site.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions of improvements</h3>
<p>
Currently the pages are reffered to in accessed time order in the vector. This
means that when an items is accessed it is reinserted at the top. This is very
wasteful, and it would be better if this was implemented differently.
</p>
<p>
Currently the tree is tail compressed, but it would be good to look into
whether internal nodes could also be compressed.
</p>
<p>
It would be interesting to look into whether titles could also be shared
strings in a similar manner to the urls.
</p>

<h1>Direct History</h1>

<h2>API</h2>

<h3>class DirectHistory</h3>

Currently DirectHistory is simply an array of uni_char strings.

<h2>File formats</h2>

<p>
See description of the <a href="file_format.html">file formats</a> used by
Direct History.
</p>

<h2>Memory usage</h2>

<h3>Used OOM policies</h3>

<p>
Direct History has no real OOM Policy. It allocates the array at startup and
will leave if this fails. Otherwise it copies the strings it inserts but no
test is done to check that the copy succeeded.
</p>

<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>
<p>
There are hardly any tests to check for OOM and noone is notified if they are
encountered outside of the allocation of the array.
</p>

<h3>Description of flow</h3>
<p>
There is no real flow to speak of, an item is inserted and the list of items
can be retrieved.
</p>

<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>
Direct history allocates an array with length equal to
PrefsCollectionCore::MaxDirectHistory which indicates the maximum number of
elements and will copy all strings added to it.
</p>

<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>
There is no stack memory usage in Direct History.
</p>

<h3>Static memory usage</h3>
<p>
There is only one global variable for the Direct History : g_directHistory
</p>

<h3>Caching and freeing memory</h3>

<p>
There are no caches. All the strings stored will be deleted if DeleteAllItems()
is called - this will however also empty the opera.dir file.
</p>

<h3>Freeing memory on exit</h3>
<p>
All the memory is freed when the Direct History is deleted.
</p>

<h3>Temp buffers</h3>
<p>
The module does not use the tempbuffers from the memory manager.
</p>

<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
<p>
Currently there is no way to tune the memory usage other than to reduce the
number of items allowed in direct history - this can be done runtime by
calling the Size function with the new maximum number of items.
</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
There are no specific memory tests for this module.
</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>
There are no selftests for direct history yet.
</p>

<h3>Design choices</h3>
<p>
The design is simple : it is a list of strings.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions of improvements</h3>
<p>
There are currently no real plans of improvements other than to move over to
using an OpVector rather than the array.
