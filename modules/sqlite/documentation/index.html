<h1>Module: sqlite</h1>

<h2>About this module</h2>

<p>This module is a wrapper around SQLite.
	SQLite is a in-process library that implements a self-contained,
	serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.
	More info at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/about.html">SQLite's
	about page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Interface overview and API documentation</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html">SQLite documentation
  </a> is your friend.
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/intro.html">SQLite version 3
  C/C++ API reference</a>
</p>

<h2>Implementation description</h2>

<p>
  SQLite is used in core so far only by the database module. No other
  modules should access SQLite's APIs directly. To use sql databases
  in your project, check the database module documentation. So far
  the API is refined to support Web SQL Databases, but improvements are
  accepted.
</p>

<h2>IMPORTANT: Sqlite updates</h2>
<p>Because SQLite is a 3rd party library, it needs to be periodically
   updated. The following steps need to be followed:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Run the modules/sqlite/update-sqlute.py script which downloads
	it and places it in the sqlite/src folder. You still have to evaluate
	if everything seems ok, including the download script, and commit.</li>
	<li>An outstanding patch for SQLite that allows SQLite to interrupt
	and resume queries, plus fix a couple compile warnings, needs to be
	applied. See tag <code><a
	href="https://cgit.oslo.osa/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/core/work/tag/?h=sqlite-opera-patch">
	sqlite-opera-patch</a></code>. If the patch does not apply cleanly,
	then a new patch needs to be produced, commited, and the tag needs to
	be updated to refer to the new commit.
	</li>
	<li>Run the selftests for the sqlite module. The tests are not exaustive,
	but they check that everything compile and works, and they check as
	well that the patch above is working properly. If the selftests fail
	then something is wrong.</li>
</ol>
