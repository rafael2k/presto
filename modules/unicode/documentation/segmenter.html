 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  This document describes the internals of the text segmentation
  implementation
  (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/">Unicode Standard
  Annex #29 &mdash; Text Segmentation</a>).
 </p>

 <h2 id="grapheme">Grapheme cluster boundaries</h2>
 <p>
  Grapheme cluster boundary detection does not require a state machine,
  so there is a simple API that takes two characters and reports if there
  is a boundary between them.
  This boundary detection is implemented by going through the various
  GB<var>x</var> rules, in succession, and returning the result from the
  first matching rule.
 </p>
 
 <h2 id="word">Word boundaries</h2>
 <p>
  Word boundary detection is implemented using a state machine, which
  is described in the below diagram.
  Please note that due to the use of a state machine with one character
  look-ahead, the two rules which require a two-character look-ahead
  (WB6 and WB12) are not handled correctly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Green edges denote that a break exists, red that one does not.
  If there is no specific transition from a state, the transition from
  the unlabelled state is used.

 <h2 id="sentence">Sentence boundaries</h2>
 <p>
  Sentence boundary detection is implemented using a state machine,
  which is described in the below diagram.
 </p>
 <p>
  Green edges denote that a break exists, red that one does not.
  If there is no specific transition from a state, the transition from
  the <em>any</em> state is used.
  The <em>any'</em> state is special, transitions to it are treated as
  transitions <em>from</em> the <em>any</em> state, except that a
  break is reported.
