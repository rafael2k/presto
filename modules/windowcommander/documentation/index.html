<h1>WindowCommander Module</h1>
<p id="toc"></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The windowcommander module provides interfaces to the Opera core code
to be used by the product and user interface specific
code. OpWindowCommander is an API that user interface code uses to
instruct core to load and display content into a window.
</p>

<h2>Diagrams</h2>

<h2>Design principles</h2>

<h3>Listeners</h3>
<p>
The windowcommander code uses listeners heavily to allow callbacks
into the code using its interfaces. The listener design principle is
described <a href="../../coredoc/core-api/design-principles.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>The burger model</h3>

<p>See the <a
href="../../pi/documentation/index.html#burger-model">burger
model</a>, to understand the relationship between windowcommander,
core and the pi module.</p>

<h2>Envelope of Change</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is a maximum of one listener implementation per listener
interface set at a time.</li>
</ul>

with Doxygen.

<h2>WindowCommander interfaces</h2>
<p>
The OpWindowCommander and the related interfaces work as the interface
between core windows and the UI. The OpWindowCommander interface allow
the UI code to do operations on the core windows and the different
listener interfaces enables the UI to be notified on certain events
happening inside the core window.
</p>

<h3>OpWindowCommanderManager</h3>
<p>
This interface is there for managing OpWindowCommander objects. There
are two ways a UI window can be created. It can be initiated from the
UI, or from the core.
</p>

<p>
When the creation of a new UI window is initiated from the UI side,
e.g. when the user clicks the New icon on the toolbar, the UI will
need to create an OpWindowCommander object by calling
GetWindowCommander on the OpWindowCommanderManager interface, then
create an OpWindow to have a platform specific window to be used by
the core, and finally tell the core about the new window by calling
OnUiWindowCreated on the newly created OpWindowCommander.
</p>

<p>
When the creation of a new UI window is initiated from the core, the
core will create an OpWindowCommander interface object for it and call
CreateUiWindow on the OpUiWindowListener. The UI is responsible for
creating an OpWindow and tell the core about it through
OnUiWindowCreated. An example of a new UI window created from core is
when opening Javascript pop-ups.
</p>

<p>
OpWindowCommanderManager also provides the functionality for
authentication. The reason why this functionality is put here, is that
authentication of URLs is not necessarily related to a specific
window, and hence not a specific OpWindowCommander. One example is
the authentication of URLs loaded by the JavaResourceHandler.
</p>

<a href="api/classOpWindowCommanderManager.html">OpWindowCommanderManager doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpUiWindowListener</h3>
<p>
Listener interface on the OpWindowCommanderManager for telling the
clients of the core API that the core code has either created or
closed a window.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpUiWindowListener.html">OpUiWindowListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpAuthenticationListener</h3>
<p>
Listener interface on the OpWindowCommanderManager for letting the UI
code ask the user for login name and password to be used for authentication.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpAuthenticationListener.html">OpAuthenticationListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpWindowCommander</h3>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, OpWindowCommander acts as the interface between
a core window and the UI. It supports several methods for operating on
the window including: opening urls, start/stop loading, history
navigation, setting/retrieving statuses/modes, text selection, search,
etc. A set of listeners facilitates signalling the UI that certain
events occur inside the Opera core.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpWindowCommander.html">OpWindowCommander doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpLoadingListener</h3>
<p>
The OpLoadingListener can be implemented to keep track of loading
progress through: OnStartLoading, OnLoadingProgress, and
OnLoadingFinished. OnUrlChanged will be called if the core changes the
url loaded in the window. E.g. due to a redirect or refresh. Also,
OpLoadingListener has a method for letting the UI ask for
username/password for authentication. For authentication of URLs
directly related to a window, this interface is used for
authentication, not the OpAuthenticationListener in the
OpWindowCommanderManager described earlier.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpLoadingListener.html">OpLoadingListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpHistoryListener</h3>
<p>
This listener interface is not in use. Will probably be removed.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpHistoryListener.html">OpHistoryListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpErrorListener</h3>
<p>
This interface is currently not in use.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpErrorListener.html">OpErrorListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpDocumentListener</h3>
<p>
The largest listener interface on OpWindowCommander is the
OpDocumentListener. The methods can be categorized into:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Window operations</strong> - changed size, raised/lowered,
closed. These are initiated from the core, normally through scripting.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Navigation</strong> - document and link navigation, hovering, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mode changes</strong> - images on/off, css, security, print
preview, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Drag and drop</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpDocumentListener.html">OpDocumentListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpAccessKeyListener</h3>
<p>
Access keys are single keys assigned to a document element as a way of
giving this element focus <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2">as
described in the html spec</a>. The OpAccessKeyListener interface on
the OpWindowCommander is used to tell the UI that access keys are added
or removed. Adding happens during parsing of a document as the
accesskey attributes are parsed or if the accesskey attribute is
changed through DOM. Removal can happen if the attribute is removed or
altered through DOM.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpAccessKeyListener.html">OpAccessKeyListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpLinkListener</h3>
<p>
A listener interface offering two methods: OnAlternateCssAvailable and
OnLinkElementAvailable. Both are called when a document has finished
loading.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
OnAlternateCssAvailable is called if the loaded document
contains one or more alternate stylesheets. That is, there is one or
more link elements with the rel attribute set to "alternate stylesheet".
</li>
<li>
OnLinkElementAvailable is called if there is at least one link element
in the loaded document.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpLinkListener.html">OpLinkListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpPrintingListener</h3>
<p>
This interface is for keeping track of printing status. The core calls
OnPrintStatus when printing starts, for each page printed, when
printing is finished, and if the printing has been aborted.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpPrintingListener.html">OpPrintingListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpMenuListener</h3>
<p>
This one is used for telling the UI that the user has right-clicked on the
document. The UI should open a context menu depending on what was
under the mouse pointer (or whichever input device was
used). Currently supported contexts are: document, link, image,
text-selection, and mail-to. There is currently no support for
different window types, so Quick currently accesses the core Window
directly to decide upon different context menus (this will have to be changed).
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpMenuListener.html">OpMenuListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h2>TransferManager interfaces</h2>
<p>
The TransferManager interfaces support downloading URLs and keeping
track of the size and the estimated time remaining of a given URL. The
OpTransferManager keeps a collection of OpTransferItem objects which
can be used to start, stop, and continue loading of URLs. This
functionality is used for implementing downloading of URLs in Opera
through the transfer panel, but could also be used in other parts of
the code where download functionality is needed.
</p>

<h3>OpTransferManager</h3>
<p>
The OpTransferManager is a container keeping track of the
OpTransferItems currently existing. The clients of the
OpTransferManager calls the OpTransferManager to create new OpTransferItem
objects, and they are responsible for releasing them when they are no
longer used. Clients can keep track of added OpTransferItems by
implementing the OpTransferManagerListener interface.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpTransferManager.html">OpTransferManager doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpTransferManagerListener</h3>
<p>
A listener interface which can be implemented and set on the
OpTransferManager to keep control of added OpTransferItems. E.g. in
the TransferPanel of Quick, this listener is implemented to add UI
elements to the transfer panel representing the items being
downloaded.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpTransferManagerListener.html">OpTransferManagerListener doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpTransferItem</h3>
<p>
For each transfer/download, an OpTransferItem is created by calling
GetTransferItem in the OpTransferManager. Each transfer item can
start, stop, and resume a transfer.
</p>

<p>
<a href="api/classOpTransferItem.html">OpTransferItem doxygen documentation.</a>
</p>

<h3>OpTransferListener</h3>
<p>
It is possible to track the progress of an OpTransferItem by
implementing the OpTransferListener interface and set a listener
implementation object on the OpTransferItem. The OpTransferListener
implementation is notified regularly about the current status of the
transfer through the OnProgress method.

<h2>Memory handling</h2>

<h3>Used OOM policies</h3>

<p>In most cases, since the windowcommander methods are called
directly by UI/product/platform code, the implementation of the
virtual methods in the module handles OOM situations without further
propagation, by calling MemoryManager::RaiseCondition()
directly. There are however also some methods that return OP_STATUS
values to the caller instead. The LEAVE mechanism is only used during
module initialization.</p>

<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>

<p>OOM is usually handled by windowcommander directly. See previous
chapter.</p>

<h3>Description of flow </h3>

<p>As a thin layer between core and UI code, the windowcommander
module is fairly simple, and so is its code flow. It typically goes
like this:</p>

<ol>

 <li>The user does something in the UI (e.g. click a "Back in history"
 button)</li>

 <li>UI code calls a method in windowcommander
 (e.g. OpWindowCommander::Previous())</li>

 <li>windowcommander does the right stuff in core
 (e.g. Window::SetHistoryPrev())</li>

 <li>Core does its stuff and returns, with an error code if something
 went wrong. Normally, if an OOM error occured, this will be dealt
 with internally in windowcommander, and the UI code will at best be
 told that something went wrong. In many cases, what core was told to
 do by the UI is carried out asynchronously, and one or several
 listener method calls may be called later to notify the UI about
 progress and result.</li>

</ol>

<p>or:</p>

<ol>

 <li>Something happened in core that the UI should be made aware of
 (e.g. the document title changed)</li>

 <li>Core calls a listener method class in windowcommander
 (e.g. OpDocumentListener::OnTitleChanged())</li>

 <li>The implementation of OpDocumentListener in the UI code does its
 stuff.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>In general the windowcommander module itself doesn't allocate
memory at many sites. The transfer manager code allocates some pieces
here and there though. A few OpWindowCommander methods also allocate
some. There is e.g. a method that allocates and creates an image
(OpBitmap). Another method allocates a string containing all text on
the clipboard. The memory from both these potentially fairly large
memory allocations are sent to the UI code, which takes over
ownership. Lifespan is not documented.</p>

<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>Negligible. Worst-case scenario is when the UI calls a method in
windowcommander, which calls a method in core, which calls a listener
method defined in windowcommander, ending up back in the UI code.</p>

<h3>Static memory usage</h3>

<p>Negligible.</p>

<h3>Caching and freeing memory</h3>

<p>The windowcommander module is too simple and stupid for caching.</p>

<h3>Freeing memory on exit</h3>

<p>The UI code is responsible for deleting all OpWindowCommander
objects (including those created by core and passed via
OpUiWindowListener::CreateUiWindow()), by calling
OpWindowCommanderManager::ReleaseWindowCommander() on each
object. Other data allocated (OpBitmap, clipboard text) with ownership
transferred to UI code must also be deleted by UI code. The rest of
the memory used by windowcommander is deleted automatically at module
shutdown.</p>

<h3>Temp buffers</h3>

<p>OpWindowCommander::GetSelectedLinkInfo() uses a temp buffer. We
should consider fixing that, although the risk for the temp buffer to
already be in use, is close to none.</p>

<h3>Memory tuning</h3>

<p>No tuning. Memory usage increases with each window created. The UI
may limit memory usage by limiting the number of simultaneous open
windows.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

<p>No memory tests.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>Make a full-blown web browser UI using windowcommander.</p>

<h3>Design choices</h3>

<p>The overall idea is that windowcommander should deal with memory
allocation as little as possible on its own.</p>

<h3>Suggestions of improvements</h3>

<p>Get rid of shared temp buffer usage?</p>
