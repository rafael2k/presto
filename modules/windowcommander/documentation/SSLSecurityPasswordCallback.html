<H1>Security Password dialog</H1>

<p>
The security password dialog must be based on WindowCommander's OpSSLListener::SSLSecurityPasswordCallback class and must contain the following elements:
<p>
<UL>
<li> A message describing what is needed.
<li> An input field for the password.
<li> OK and Cancel buttons.
</UL>

<p>Depending on the mode, further fields may be needed</p>
<p>
<strong>IMPLEMENTATION !!!NOTE!!!</strong> For security reasons all temporary memory MUST be nulled BEFORE being freed, or function exits <strong>!!!NOTE!!!</strong> 
</p>


<p>Class SSLSecurtityPasswordCallbackImpl is a default implementaion of OpSSLListener::SSLSecurityPasswordCallback interface. It is implementing OnSecurityPasswordDone() callback.
	
<p>Its constructor takes as arguments:
<ul>
<li> A password mode (just a password, new password, or change password) that controls the look and flow of the dialog's implementation.
<li> A title string code, used to describe the purpose of the dialog in the title.
<li> A message string code, used to give a more detailed description inside the dialog of what is expected.
<li> A SSL_dialog_config object providing infomation about the associated Window object and finished messages to be posted. See the docxs information.
</ul>

<p>Multiple callers can add themselves as listeners for the dialog by calling ctx->AddMessage on the context with a dialog config object as parameter.

<p>Once constructed, the owner calls the ctx->StartDialog() function and starts waiting for the message callback.

<p> When finished the caller can retrieve the password using ctx->GetPassword(), and in case of changing password ctx->GetOldPassword() to retrieve the old password.
