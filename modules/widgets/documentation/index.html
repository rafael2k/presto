<h2>1. Used OOM policies, Who is handling OOM? and Description of flow</h2>

It uses OP_STATUS on functions that is usually being called from core (f.ex. from the formscode).<br>
Inputcode and related functions which is called from UI/input is raising a memorycondition without returning anything. (This is because input is coming from the platformcode which we don't want to take care of core OOM in.)<br>
