ACTION_SELECT_ITEM					emil

	This action should always be enabled. It replaces the hardcoded OP_KEY_ENTER for selecting item and close dropdownmenu.
	So you should from now on probably also specify this in your input.ini file. For desktop it could f.ex be "Enter = Show dropdown | Select item"

	String:		"Select item"
	Depends on:	nothing

ACTION_UNFOCUS_FORM				simonb

	Used by element-of-interest code.

	Depends on: FEATURE_NEARBY_ELEMENT_DETECTION
