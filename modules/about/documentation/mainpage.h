@section api API

The OpGeneratedDocument interface is provided to have a consistent API
for all internally generated (X)HTML documents, and to provide common
services for the documents that inherit it.

This module both implements several sub-classes to OpGeneratedDocument,
and provides an API for other modules that wish to generate documents
to display to the user.
