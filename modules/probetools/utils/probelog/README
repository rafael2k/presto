Probe log viewer
================

Simple opera widget for visualizing a probe log file.  Probe logs are
created automatically when probetools are enabled and
ENABLED_OP_PROBE_LOG (in modules/probetools/probepoint_enabling.h) is
set to non-zero.  When an Opera built with these premisses exists, the
log is saved in <OPFILE_TEMP_FOLDER>/probedata/probelog.txt.

To use the widget:

 1. 'make && make install' to have opera install the widget.

 2. Launch widget and press 'Load file'. Find the 'probelog.txt' on
    the file system.

 3. The beginning log should now be drawn, use the panel in upper-left
    to scale and offset the log.
