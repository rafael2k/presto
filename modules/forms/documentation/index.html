<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>This module contains much of the support for HTML and WML
forms. It's responsible for configuring and displaying widgets
correctly and it's responsible for keeping track of form values and
creating form submits.</p>
<p>
Some form handling still exists outside the forms module. DOM
interfaces and relevent code is found in the dom and the logdoc
module. The widgets are in the widgets module. Forms filling from wand
is in the wand module. Event handling is in the doc, logdoc and
widgets module. Form parsing is is in the logdoc module. Actual
posting (or getting) to the target server is done by the network code.

<h2><a name="access">How to access form data</a></h2>
To access the value in a form control, you use the FormValue class that can be gotten from HTML_Element for every element of type HE_INPUT, HE_SELECT, HE_TEXTAREA, HE_KEYGEN or HE_BUTTON (and HE_OUTPUT for WebForms2).

<h3>FormValue</h3>

<h4>For normal text data</h4>
This works for most everything but checkboxes, radio buttons and select lists.
<code>HTML_Element* elm = ...; // Must be an HE_INPUT or HE_BUTTON (or HE_OUTPUT)
FormValue* val = elm->GetFormValue(); // Never null
OpString text;
OP_STATUS status = val->GetValueAsText(elm, text);
// Check status
</code>

<h4>For check boxes and radio buttons</h4>
<code>HTML_Element* elm = ...; // Must be an HE_INPUT with InputType INPUT_CHECKBOX or INPUT_RADIO
FormValueRadioCheck* val = FormValueRadioCheck::GetAs(elm->GetFormValue()); // Never null
BOOL is_checked = val->IsChecked(elm);
</code>

<h4>For check boxes and radio buttons</h4>
<code>HTML_Element* elm = ...; // Must be an HE_INPUT with InputType INPUT_CHECKBOX or INPUT_RADIO
FormValueRadioCheck* val = FormValueRadioCheck::GetAs(elm->GetFormValue()); // Never null
BOOL is_checked = val->IsChecked(elm);
</code>

<h4>For check boxes and radio buttons</h4>
<code>HTML_Element* elm = ...; // Must be a HE_SELECT
FormValueList* val = FormValueList::GetAs(elm->GetFormValue()); // Never null
</code>
See the api for details of what you can do to a value list.

<h2><a name="parsing">How forms are/should be parsed</a></h2>

Ideally in a web page every <tt>form</tt> tag creates a form. A form
may have zero or more form controls (for instance <tt>input</tt>
elements or <tt>button</tt> elements). In Opera we keep a number with
forms and form controls which connect form controls to the right
form. This number is not used for DOM inserted forms/form controls and
not for XHTML.

<h3>Nested forms</h3>
<p>
In general nested forms have been illegal and ignored, but they are
possible to create anyway with XML or with DOM.
</p>

<h3>Parsing HTML</h3>
<p>
In pure HTML (not XML) nested forms are illegal and the parsing used
is one compatible with old browsers. Since forms cannot be nested, the
parser needs only to remember which form is the current actives. If a
new form tag is seen by the parser while there already is one form
active (thus illegally nested) it is ignored from a form structure
perspective (the old form remains the current active form). There may
still be an HE_FORM element which is accessible from DOM and used in
layout but it will not contain any form controls and it will not be
seen in form collections from DOM.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever a <tt>&lt;/form&gt;</tt> is encountered and a current form
  is active, we close the active form. That is even if that
  <tt>&lt;/form&gt;</tt> from a HTML/XML structure point of view
  belongs to some other <tt>&lt;form&gt;</tt> tag than the current
  active one.
</p>
<p>
  When we encounter a form control we set it to belong to the current
  active form, or to be free if there is none. Free controls have the
  form number -1, but as do form controls inserted by DOM.
</p>
<p>
  Example:
</p>
<code>
  &lt;form id="outer-form"&gt;
    &lt;input id="control-1" /&gt;
    &lt;form id="inner-form-1"&gt;
      &lt;input id="control-2" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;form id="inner-form-2"&gt;
      &lt;input id="control-3" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
</code>
<p>
  Here control-1 and control-2 will belong to outer-form. inner-form-1
  will not exist from a form point of view, but its end tag will close
  outer-form. control-3 will belong to inner-form-2. The last end-form
  tag is trailing and doesn't belong to any form.
</p>
<h3>Parsing XHTML</h3>

<p>For XHTML the tree structure is everything. A form control belongs
to the form that is closest parent, or is a free control if it has no
such parent.</p>

<p>
  In the example above all three forms will have one control
  each. control-1 will belong to outer-form, control-2 will belong to
  inner-form-1 and control-3 will belong to inner-form-2.
</p>

<h3>DOM inserted forms and controls</h3>

<p>For DOM inserted forms and form controls we have the same treatment
as for XHTML, we look at tree structure primarily.</p>


<h2><a name="webforms2">WebForms2</a></h2>
Forms has an optional part - WebForms2 - that is still under
development. It consists of forms extensions as layed out in the <a
 href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/">Web Forms 2
specification.</a>
<h2><a name="uses">Modules that use the forms module and modules the forms module uses</a></h2>

<a name="memory"><h2>Memory management</h2></a>
<h3>OOM policy</h3>
Sad to say, the module uses a mix of OOM policys, but in all new code
OP_STATUS should be used. Right now LEAVE is used at some places.
<p>In case of a OOM error the objects will clean up their internal
state and propagate the error to the caller, except for Form::GetURL
that returns an empty URL instead.
</p>
<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>
Operations that submit data will normally use memory proportional to
the amount of data in the form controls. Other operations will use
memory proportional to the number of (not hidden) form elements.
<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

The module uses no recursive algorithms so the usage is bounded and
not very large (less than 1024 bytes).

<h3>Memory ownership</h3>
The classes take care of their own memory.
<h3>Temporary buffers</h3>
Both TempBuf and TempBuf2 are used internally by GetURL().
<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
No tuning possible.
<h3>Tests and coverage</h3>
Any form page will get a quite high coverage in non webforms2 code. The
selftests for webforms2 will get a high coverage in the rest of the
code.

<h3>Design choices</h3>
<p>Some of the old code has been written by many people and lacks a
common design. Basically most of the code act as utility code called
from other places or as proxy code between the layout module and the
widgets.</p>
<p>The main goals are the same as for Opera in general. Correct, fast,
low footprint and non-blocking.</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create FormValue. <b>DONE</b></li>
<li>Improve memory handling, looking over use of temporary buffers.</li>
<li>Include better form suggestions, based on earlier input.</li>
<li>Make event handling less dependant on the widgets. <b>DONE</b></li>
<li>Make key generation in the &lt;keygen&gt; tag non-blocking.</li>
</ul>
