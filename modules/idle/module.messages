MSG_IDLE_DELAYED_IDLE_CHECK                andersr

	When doing idle detection in Core, there can be more work lined up in the
	message queue (i.e. activity to could triggered by processing the pending
	messages in the queue).

	When we appear to be idle, we post this message with a 1ms delay and check
	if we are still idle when the message is dispatched. If we are still idle,
	we notify listeners that the activity state was changed.

	Depends on: nothing
