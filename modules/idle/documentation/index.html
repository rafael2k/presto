		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The <em>idle module</em> implements <em>idle detection</em> in Core.
			Idle detection attempts to solve the problem of when Core is "sufficiently
			idle" for a testcase to proceed to the next action. (In particular,
			testcases often want to know when the consequences of a click on a page are
			"finished").
		</p>
		<p>
			The idle detection works by placing probe-like objects around in code which
			performs central tasks, like paint and reflow. These objects report to a
			manager when their related activity beings and ends, and the manager in
			turn reports to a set of listeners when we move from an idle state with
			no live activities, to a busy state (and vice-versa).
		</p>
		
		<h2>API</h2>
		<p>
		Components interested in knowing when we are idle (or when we leave an
		idle state) must implement the <code>OpActivityListener</code> interface, and
		subscribe for the events using <code>OpIdleDetector::AddListener</code>. The
		<code>OpIdleDetector</code> singleton is globally available under the alias
		<code>g_idle_detector</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Please see the <a href="api/index.html">generated documentation</a> for
		details. You must run <code>doxygen</code> in the
		<code>modules/idle/documentation</code> folder to make this
		documentation available.
