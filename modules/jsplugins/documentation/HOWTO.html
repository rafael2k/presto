<h1>HOWTO write an Opera Native JavaScript Extension</h1>

<address>rikard@opera.com</address>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

Native JavaScript Extensions are provided as a way to interface with the native
environment from from the JavaScript environment. A possible use is
for set top box manufacturers to control their hardware (eg tv tuners)
from an HTML user interface. Other uses could be to create file
objects and other functionality that is not included in JavaScript.

<p>

Or to quote the internal design draft:

<p>
<quote>[Native JavaScript Extensions] provide DOM-like functionality on objects that are not
part of DOM or JavaScript; these objects may be system-dependent,
unsafe, obscure, or otherwise not desirable to include in Opera in
general.</quote>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>

In the current implementation, the directory "jsplugins" under the
Opera binary directory is scanned for .dll (W*ndows) files at startup.
Under U**X, ~/.opera/jsplugins is scanned for .so files. If the
library exports the symbol jsplugin_capabilities (see header file for
details), the library is kept loaded, and the plugin is registered.

<p>

The plugin can then receive requests to do its stuff. These requests
are given via callbacks that have been set during initialization.

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>

To the plugin:

<ul>
  <li>the plugin exported function jsplugin_capabilities is called when Opera starts up and scans the plugin directory. The function gets the Opera callbacks in the second of its
arguments. Keep this for later use.
</ul>

<p>
From the plugin:
<ul>
  <li> jsplugin_capabilities should fill in a <code>struct jsplugin_cap</code> and send it back in <code>result</code>. Its fields are:
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>global_names</code>: a NULL terminated array of names that the plugin
	      responds to.
	 <li> <code>global_getter</code>: responds to requests for the plugin to get one of the
	      names above. See <a href="#getters_setters">Getters and setters</a>.
	 <li> <code>global_setter</code>: responds to requests for the plugin to set one of the
	      names above. See <a href="#getters_setters">Getters and setters</a>.
	 <li> <code>init</code> and <code>destroy</code>: initialization and destruction functions for the
	      plugin itself.
       </ul>
</ul>

<code>js_plugin_capabilities</code> should return 0 on success and non-zero otherwise.

<h2>Calling back</h2>

<p>
Function and regular objects are created in Opera's ecmascript engine
via callbacks. The arguments to these callbacks include:

<ul>
  <li> <code>refobj</code>: used for setting up the environment for the object. You get
       this in most calls. It can also be called <code>global_context</code> (eg in <code>jsplugin_document_init</code>).
  <li> <code>getter/setter</code>: used to get and set names (properties/functions) on the
       object.
  <li> <code>f_call</code>: used for giving the native function to be called when the
       javascript function is called.
  <li> <code>constructor</code>: the constructor for the object.
       
  <li> <code>f_signature</code>: what arguments the function takes.
       See the <a href="#function_signatures">About function signatures</a>
       section.

  <li> <code>destructor</code>: the destructor for the object.
  <li> <code>result</code>: here you get the object in question.
</ul>

<target id="function_signatures">
<h2>About function signatures</h2>
<p>

Function signatures indicate what arguments a javascript function
takes. Basically, one can combine "s" (string), "n" (number), "b"
(boolean) and "-" (any object) as one needs.

<p>

So, "snb" will make the function take (string, number, boolean) as
arguments. If more arguments are passed than is specified in the signature, they are treated as the last
type. Thus, a signature of "n" makes the function accept (number, number, number ...)

The function signatures actually represents the requested argument conversion, so
the "-" character represents no conversion and needs to be used where an object argument is expected.
This meens it's possible to write a function that takes an argument "-", that could be of any type
and the type checking is done in the function implementation.

<p>

It's up to the native implementation to check that the number and type
of arguments is meaningful. The number of arguments can usually be
found as an argc argument, and the type can be checked in the
<code>type</code> member of the <code>struct jsplugin_value</code>.

<h2>Extending the OBJECT element</h2>
<p>

Extending the OBJECT element is straightforward, and bears many
similarities to creating a custom JavaScript extension. Some notable
differences are:

<ul>
  <li> <code>jsplugin_cap.object_types</code> and <code>jsplugin_cap.handle_object</code> have to be filled in (see below)
  <li> <code>jsplugin_cap.global_{getter,setter}</code> shouldn't be filled in
</ul>

<h3>The MIME types array</h3>
<p>

<code>jsplugin_cap.object_types</code> is the equivalent to
<code>jsplugin_cap.global_names</code>, but for OBJECT extensions.
Like its colleague, it's a NULL terminated array, but in this case of
MIME types that the OBJECT plugin is able to handle.

<p>

See the example code for -- examples.

<h3>Handling of object requests</h3>
<p>

During initialization, one also has to set the field <code>jsplugin_cap.handle_object</code>.

<p>

When a custom OBJECT is found in the html and the plugin has the right
permissions set (see the section <a href="#plugin_permissions">Giving
permissions to a plugin</a>), this callback will be called.

<p>

As parameters, the callback gets a number of parameters:

<ul>
  <li> a pointer to a global context (see <a href="#global_context">The global context</a>)
  <li> a pointer to the OBJECT object. This can be used to identify what OBJECT is being referred to, and to save plugin private data (see <a href"plugin_private_data">Plugin private data</a>
  <li> the attribute count and the attributes: one can iterate over
       the attribute list to find out what attributes were given in the html.
       Eg: <code>&lt;OBJECT TYPE="application/tve-trigger"
       ID="triggerReceiverObj"&gt;&lt;/OBJECT&gt;</code> gives
       <code>attrs_count == 2</code> and two items in the <code>attrs</code>
       array.

  <li> <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code>: these can be used
       to respond to getname and putname requests to the object. They behave
       similarly to the getters and setters of javascript plugin objects. See <a href="#getters_setters">Getters and setters</a>.

  <li> a destructor that will be called when the object is garbage collected.
       
  <li> two notification callbacks, inserted and removed. these will be
       called when the OBJECT is inserted and removed from the DOM structure,
       respectively. Note that this is distinctly different from that the
       OBJECT is created and destroyed.

</ul>

It should return one of the JSP_OBJECT_* status types.

<target id="plugin_permissions">
<h2>Giving permissions to a plugin</h2>
<p>

Plugin permissions are used to determine what server may serve content that instansiates and executes code contained in javascript and OBJECT plugins. The default value is that content from no server may access no javascript or OBJECT plugins whatsoever.

<p>

To ease this somewhat boring (but very secure) set of default
restrictions, plugin permissions can be declared in the
<code>jsplugins.ini</code> ini file. It is looked for in the same
directory as the plugins themselves. This roughly means
~/.opera/jsplugins/ under U**X-like platforms, and
<code><i>opera_exe_dir</i>/jsplugins/</code> under W*NDOWS.

<h3>The format</h3>
<p>

The file should contain a list of plugin permissions on the form <code>plugin_id: protocol, server, port</code>, where:

<ul>
  
  <li> plugin_id is the file name of the plugin without the path,
       including its .so/.dll extension

  <li> server is the name or ip address of the server allowed to serve
       content that uses the plugin in question. There is a syntax for describing that all hosts in a domain should be allowed: <code>[ALL]</code>. See the examples

  <li> port is the port number that content is allowed to be served
       from. 0 (zero, nought) represents the default port, and should
       be given in all cases where the protocol's default port is used and
       not explicitly given in the URL. (Note: this means that if you
       give "http" as the protocol and then give 80 as the port, then you
       have to always give the protocol in the URL or the content will be
       blocked.)

</ul>

<p>

An example jsplugins.ini could be:

<pre>
triggerreceiver.so: http, myserver.company.com, 0
videoplayer.so: http, myserver.company.com, 0
videoplayer.so: http, myserver2.company.com, 8080
videoplayer.so: file, localhost, 0
videoplayer.so: http, [ALL].corporation.com, 0
</pre>

This will allow two of the example plugins via http to be instantiated
in content from myserver.company.com on the default port for http.
videoplayer.so will also be allowed in content from
myserver2.company.com served via http on port 8080, and in content
coming via file from localhost.

<p>

In addition, the last line indicates that all hosts under the
corporation.com domain will be allowed to serve content that
instantiates the videoplayer plugin.

<h3>Getting more advanced</h3>
<p>

There is also a more advanced way of handling permissions, and that is
that the plugin itself handles the security permissions, which can be
necessary for complex security schemes. If the plugin sets the
<code>jsplugin_cap::allow_access</code> callback and the keyword
<code>CALLBACK</code> is in the protocol field of one of the plugin's
lines in <code>jsplugins.ini</code>, the <code>allow_access</code>
callback will be called to determine whether the plugin should be
allowed to be instantiated or not in a particular document.

<pre>
videoplayer.so: CALLBACK
</pre>

will make the videoplayer's security be handled by itself. If there are multiple lines for a certain plugin where one line states CALLBACK, the behaviour is undefined.

<p>

The callback gets the protocol, the hostname of the accessing host and
the port number as arguments. It should return non-zero to grant
access.

<h3>Comments, whitespace and strictness</h3>
<p>

There can be comments in the <code>jsplugins.ini</code> file, but only on lines for themselves. Comment lines start with # .

<p>

Eg

<pre>
# this line is a comment
</pre>

<p>

Whitespace is allowed both before the ";" on comment lines and before and in between fields on the permissions lines.

<p>

Lines that do not adhere to this (in some ways rather strict) format will be considered invalid and will be discarded.

<target id="global_context">
<h2>The global context</h2>
<p>

The global context is often given as a parameter to functions in the plugin, and the plugin often has to pass it back into Opera. It can be viewed as a token or a reference to the javascript global context. It enables Opera to create the plugin in the right context, regarding global environment, execution permissions etc.

<p>

The plugin cannot do anything with the global context. Just pass it back when required and you'll be fine. ;-)


<target id="plugin_private_data">
<h2>Plugin private data</h2>
<p>

<code>jsplugin_obj.plugin_private</code> is a pointer that the plugin can use to store things that it needs to keep in between function calls (its context, basically). The struct <code>jsplugin_obj</code> is passed in as a parameter to most functions in the plugin.

<p>

Plugin private data has to be allocated and deallocated by the plugin
itself. Good places for allocation are eg in the global getters for
jsplugin objects (or whereever needed and there exists a
<code>jsplugin_obj</code>) and in <code>handle_object</code> for
OBJECT plugins. Deallocation is best performed in the respective
plugin instance's destructor.

<target id="init_destroy">
<h2>Initialization and destruction</h2>
<p>

A plugin gets to know when a document that is allowed to instantiate
the plugin gets created and destroyed. These are useful hooks if the
plugin needs to prepare something (for example some global data) when
it can be initialized and destroy it when the document is destroyed. 
The plugin will get calls to <code>jsplugin_cap::init</code> and
<code>jsplugin_cap::destroy</code> to signal these events.

<target id="getters_setters">
<h2>Getters and setters</h2>
<p>

Getters and setters occur in a number of places in the javascript plugin api:
<ul>
  
  <li> a getter and setter has to be filled in
       <code>jsplugin_cap.global_getter</code> and
       <code>jsplugin_cap.global_setter</code> if the plugin should be able
       to answer to any requests at all (this applies to custom javascript
       objects, extension to the OBJECT element can get away without these)
       
  <li> on the other hand, <code>jsplugin_cap.handle_object</code> has
       to give a getter and a setter for looking up / setting attributes on
       the element.
       
  <li> a jsplugin object also has to give a getter and setter for its
       local names, eg <code>VideoPlayer.id</code>.

</ul>

<p>

Note: The getters/setters are quite commonly also being referred to as
getname/putname in this documentation. This is what is used in the
EcmaScript standard, for example.

<p>

Getters and setters are nothing magical. They are used to look up
names and, if the names exist, to get or set their values (or call the
functions, should they be such creatures). So, reasonable behaviour
for a getter is typically to compare the string that is being looked
up to the functions/properties that it knows it wants to support, and
then create and return either a function object (that will be called
from the javascript interpreter) or a javascript value.

<p>

When you return a string via the <tt>jsplugin_value.u.string</tt>, the
string is copied on the Opera side, and it will be garbage collected
duly. However, if you have allocated any memory to construct the
string within the plugin itself, you have the responsibility to
deallocate it yourself.

<p>

When a value is successfully found and returned from a getter, you can
return either with the code <tt>JSP_GET_VALUE</tt> or with
<tt>JSP_GET_VALUE_CACHE</tt>. If you use the latter, then the property
will not be looked up again for the lifetime of the object, but will
be cached on the Opera side. This may be useful for performance
reasons.

<p>

The best documentation on how to do this is probably the code
itself. Please have a look at the code in the <tt>examples</tt> directory in
this distribution.

<h2>String handling</h2>
<p>
Most of the time, the API implemented by the plugin does not expect strings to
contain null bytes. In this case, string handling is simple:
<tt>jsplugin_value.type</tt> will be set to <tt>JSP_TYPE_STRING</tt>, and
their value will be stored as a null-terminated string in
<tt>jsplugin_value.u.string</tt>. This is true both for values sent to Opera
from the plugin and for values sent from Opera to the plugin.

<p>However, it is possible in javascript to have null bytes in the middle of a
string. This is sometimes used to store binary data. This is handled
differently for strings sent to Opera and strings sent from Opera.

<p>
Strings sent from Opera that may contain null bytes will still have their
<tt>jsplugin_value.type</tt> field set to <tt>JSP_TYPE_STRING</tt>. The plugin
needs to read the <tt>jsplugin_value.u.len</tt> field, which gives the length
of the string in bytes, to know if the string extends beyond the first null
byte encountered.

<p>
To send a string containing null bytes to Opera, the plugin must set
<tt>jsplugin_value.type</tt> to <tt>JSP_TYPE_STRING_WITH_LENGTH</tt>, store the
string data in <tt>jsplugin_value.u.string</tt> and store the length of the
string, in bytes, in <tt>jsplugin_value.u.len</tt>. If
<tt>jsplugin_value.type</tt> is set to <tt>JSP_TYPE_STRING</tt>, Opera will
ignore the value of<tt>jsplugin_value.u.len</tt>, and will truncate the string
at the first null byte.

<h2> Asynchronous operations </h2>
<p>

It is possible to perform asynchronous getters and function calls which will
suspend the ES execution allowing the program to continue as normal. Once the
return value is ready the plugin can call <i>opera_callbacks->resume()</i>
with a reference object and the execution will continue. This results in the
getter or function to be called again and the real value can be returned.

<p>
Distinguishing a restart from a normal get or call is done by checking the
type of the <i>result</i> parameter. This is set to <tt>JSP_TYPE_UNDEFINED</tt>
for normal calls or <tt>JSP_TYPE_NULL</tt> for restarts.
When suspending execution the getter or function can set an object in the
<i>result</i> parameter. This object will be available when the getter or
function is restarted, in which case <i>result</i> will have the type
<tt>JSP_TYPE_OBJECT</tt>.

<p>
Async getters must return <tt>JSP_GET_DELAYED</tt> while function calls must
return <tt>JSP_CALL_DELAYED</tt> to suspend execution.

<h2> Miscellaneous tips </h2>
<p>

You can write plugins in C++. But remember that the default linkage of
a C++ compiled file is C++, so you'll have to put an <tt>export
"C"</tt> in front of the plugin's <tt>jsplugin_capabilities</tt> function.
