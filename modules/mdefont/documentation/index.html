<h2>Important Functions</h2>

<dl>

<dt>MDF_InitFont
<dd>Creates an MDF_FontEngine instance and stores it in MdefontModule. This instance will be used as the default engine for functions that take an optional engine as an argument. MDF_ShutdownFont should be called before opera terminates. At this time, there should be no live MDE_FONT objects created with the engine.

<dt>MDF_ShutdownFont
<dd>Destroys the instance created by MDF_InitFont

<dt>MDF_CreateFontEngine
<dd>Create an MDF_FontEngine. Any number of font engines can be created. Caller obtains ownership, and should pass the engine to MDF_DestroyFontEngine when no longer needed, at which time there should be no live MDE_FONT objects created with the engine.

<dt>MDF_DestroyFontEngine
<dd>Destroys an MDF_FontEngine created with MDF_CreateFontEngine.

<dt>MDF_AddFontFile
<dd>Adds a font file to mdf.

<dt>MDF_GetFont
<dd>Fetches a handle to a loaded font.

<dt>MDF_ReleaseFont
<dd>Releases a font fetched with a call to MDF_GetFont

<dt>MDF_StringWidth
<dd>Measures a string.

<dt>MDF_DrawString
<dd>Draws a string - optional API:s provide drawing to an OpBitmap or MDE_BUFFER.

</dl>

<h2>On using several font engines</h2>

<p>
Typically only one font engine is needed. The mdefont API makes using one font engine easy by providing MDF_InitFont and MDF_ShutdownFont, along with the default value to functions that are passed an engine. As long as only one font engine is needed, users can simply ignore MDF_FontEngine completely. The default value to the engine parameter will always correspond to the engine created by MDF_InitFont.
</p>

<p>
However, some platforms have special needs. If more than one font engine is needed - eg one for the core process and one for the ui - MDF_CreateFontEngine can be used to create any number of engines. In order to use an engine created using MDF_CreateFontEngine the engine must be explicitly passed to the functions in the mdefont API taking an optional engine as argument. Note that created fonts automatically keep track of the engine to use.
