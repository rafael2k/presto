<h1>Module: opera_auth</h1>

<h2>About this module</h2>

<p>The opera_auth module contains the code for doing authentication with Link
and Unite.</p>

<h2>Interface overview and API documentation</h2>

<p><a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> generated by Doxygen
contains all necessary information for the external APIs.</p>

<h2>Implementation description</h2>

<p><a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> generated by Doxygen
contains information about the internal organization of the module.</p>

<h3>Footprint</h3>

<p>The module is rather small. It can be enabled and disabled using the
FEATURE_OPERA_AUTH feature.</p>

<h3>Dynamic memory use and OOM handling</h3>

<dl>
<dt>OOM policies
<dd><p>All the functions handle OOM by returning a status to the caller.</p>

<dt>Who handles OOM?
<dd><p>There is no particular OOM handling. A failure code is returned to the
caller, which is expected to exit with a failure code of its own.</p>

<dt>Flow
<dd><p>An authentication request uses the g_transferManager to initiate a
HTTPS request. On completion of the request, the result is analyzed and
a listener callback is called.</p>

<dt>Heap memory usage
<dd><p>No sizeable heap memory used.</p>

<dt>Stack memory usage
<dd><p>No sizeable stack memory used.</p>

<dt>Static memory usage
<dd><p>No sizeable static memory used.</p>


<dt>Caching and freeing memory
<dd><p>No caching used.</p>

<dt>Freeing memory on exit
<dd><p>Memory is freed on exit.</p>

<dt>Temp buffers
<dd><p>No temp buffers used.</p>

<dt>Memory tuning
<dd><p>Nothing to tune.</p>

<dt>Tests
<dd><p>None.</p>

<dt>Coverage
<dd><p>A successful authentication would exercise a lot of code. However, it
is not feasible to put this in a selftest</p>

<dt>Design choices
<dd><p>Due to usage in desktop, the old OperaAuthentication interface remains
in a backwards compatible form. However, as this API has some limitations it
has been replaced by the CoreOperaAccountManager API which is a back-end for
the DOM_OperaAccountManager interface. This new API completely hides the old
implementation.</p>

<dt>Improvements
<dd><p>At present, no improvments are planned.</p>
