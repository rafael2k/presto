<h1>Conceptual Framework for Opera's Architecture</h1>

<p>I am using the conceptual framework from <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201699672/qid=1125406764/sr=8-15/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i15_xgl14/104-9829750-5179120?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Software
Architecture for Product Families</a> by Jazayeri, Ran, and van der
Linden to describe Opera's architecture.  This entails defining scope,
concerns, significant requirements, component domains, structures,
views, texture, the domain concepts, and finally the architectural
concepts.  Of these, the architectural concepts are the most
important, but it is only after tackling all the other items on the
list that we can elucidate them well.

<p>I have plagiarized some of the text from the book at the beginning
of each section in order to make the description here self-contained.


<h2>Architectural scope</h2>

Web browser application
Some components of the application to be used standalone


<h2>Architectural concerns</h2>

Portability (to a large range of systems; to be ported quickly)
Scalability (from handheld devices to large workstations)
Add-ons (eg support for optional add-ons for e-mail, rss, usenet, voip, ...)
Some components will be used standalone (ECMAScript, HTTP stack)


<h2>Architecturally significant requirements</h2>

???

<h2>Component domains</h2>


<h2>Architectural structures</h2>


<h2>Architectural views</h2>


<h2>Texture</h2>

<ul>
<li>Messaging system
<li>OP_STATUS / OpStatus / TRAP / LEAVE; macros built on and around these
<li>OpAutoPtr / OpStackAutoPtr / ANCHOR
<li>MemoryManager::tempbuffers
<li>MemHand / MemElm
<li>OpGlobal
</ul>

<h2>Domain concepts</h2>

<p><b>Application domain concepts</b> originate in application domain
analysis, they describe a web browser in terms of what it does: how it
obtains, processes, and displays data, and issues related to these
activities.

<p><b>Implementation domain concepts</b> on the other hand originate
in implementation domain analysis, they describe the platforms that
our web browsers run on: what they can and cannot do, how they behave,
and the kinds of variations found.

<h3>Application domain concepts</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Protocol types

<dd>
<p>Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FILE, FTP, IMODE, WAP

<p>These and other protocols may have to be supported, depending on
the system and the customer.  The protocol type is relevant during
content loading because it impacts how the content is processed before
it is delivered (including how it is translated, whether
authentication is performed, whether encryption and decryption must be
performed on the content, and the kind of MIME type that is inferred
if the type is missing).  It is also relevant to caching, since some
protocols inhibit caching (FILE, FTP, HTTPS), and to cookies, since
some protocols may not set cookies (many?).


<dt>Content types 

<dd>
<p>Examples: HTML, XHMTL, XML, WML, X+V, Voice, SVG, ATVEF/DCS, 
Video, Audio, JPG, GIF, TIF, BMP, ICO, PNG, JavaScript

<p>The content type determines to whom it is delivered (to the browser
or to an external agent), how the content is processed, how it is
cached (different policies for different types), and also whether it
must be decompressed before being consumed.


<dt>Loading of content

<dd>
<p>The logical view of content loading is as a separate process that
loads data and provides it piecemeal to a consumer when it is
available, and that passes along other status information.  The
consumer may start processing the data when they are available, even
if not all data are yet available.  In the case of HTML content, links
to external content (eg style sheets, images, scripts) will cause the
HTML parser to start further processes to load the linked content.

<p>Loading tasks can be stopped before they complete, if the user
stops loading.

<p>The loading is integrated with caching in the sense that if the
requested content is in the cache then the content is delivered from
the cache.

<p>Content lives at a specific address; the address is represented by
a URL in its canonical form.


<dt>Caching of content
<dt>Browsing history
<dt>Document management (Multiple windows / multiple documents / frames / iframes)
<dt>Document parsing
<dt>Document rendering (subconcepts: reflow, bidi, quirksmode, era)
<dt>Client-side execution (JavaScript, XSLT, events)
<dt>Embedded opaque content execution (applets, plugins)
<dt>Image decoding
<dt>Certificates
<dt>Authentication
<dt>Security models
<dt>Download
<dt>Upload
<dt>Cookies
<dt>Proxies
<dt>Automatic proxy configuration
<dt>Spatial navigation
<dt>User-editable preferences
<dt>User-changeable language
<dt>Error reporting / feedback to advanced users
<dt>UI responsiveness
<dt>Resilience in the face of resource limitations

</dl>

<h3>Implementation domain concepts</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Latency (as it applies to loading content and other things)
<dt>Bounded heap memory
<dt>Bounded code memory
<dt>Bounded stack
<dt>Bounded network connections
<dt>Bounded file descriptors
<dt>Poor operating systems (eg global vars, no processes, no threads, no files)
<dt>Poor libraries
<dt>Poor compilers
<dt>Poor hardware (small cache, feeble CPU, slow memory, software FP)
<dt>Poor fonts
<dt>Slow disks
<dt>Nonstandard floating point
<dt>UI technologies (mouse/pen/wheel/remote/kbd)
<dt>Display technologies
<dt>Libraries (platform/3rd party/our own)
<dt>Non-OOM safe platforms
<dt>IPV4 / IPV6
<dt>Distinguished "main thread" on some platforms
</dl>

<h2>Architectural concepts</h2>

<p>The <b>architectural concepts</b> describes how application
domain concepts are mapped to the implementation domain concepts:
essentially, how an activity in the browser can be supported on the
platforms in question.

<dl>
<dt>Interleaved loading and execution based on callbacks
<dt>Listeners / callbacks in general
<dt>Async image decoding
<dt>Async disk writing / delayed disk writing
<dt>Delayed script execution
<dt>Preempted script execution
<dt>Main-thread execution of some tasks
<dt>Font switching
<dt>Pool allocation to defeat performance problems and fragmentation
<dt>Out-of-memory handling
<dt>Out-of-disk handling
</dl>

<h2>Loose ideas, notes, etc.</h2>

<p>Note that "UI responsiveness" and "Resilience in the face of
resource limitation" are application concepts, but that specific
limitations that must be contended with (eg poor machines and limited
memory) are implementation domain concepts.

<p>We should add a <em>domain</em> string to every Feature, that states which
domain the feature is in?  What this will do is probably focus the
feature definition, and split features that are cross-domain?
