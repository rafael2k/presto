<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This document covers the mechanism of script execution proper, from
the moment a script's source code has been received and identified to
the moment when the result of the script is handed to the agent that
has requested the script's execution and the script is destroyed.</p>

<h2>The design</h2>

<h3>Programs and functions</h3>

<p>Scripts appear in two flavors, as <em>programs</em> and
<em>functions</em>.  Inline scripts and linked scripts are always
programs.  Event handlers are always functions.  The difference
between a program and a function is primarily that the latter allows a
<tt>return</tt> statement to appear on the top level; executing such a
return statement causes evaluation to terminate.  Furthermore,
programs often contain initialization actions that must only be run
once, so it is rarely natural to run the same program multiple times.
Functions are routinely run multiple times, however.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h3>Compiling scripts</h3>

<p>Scripts must always be compiled before they can be run.  ...</p>


<h3>Running scripts asynchronously</h3>

<p>Scripts are normally run asynchronously by creating a script
execution thread which is then handed off to the scheduler for later
execution.  When the execution is finished, listeners on the thread
will be notified of the completion. ...</p>

<h4>Creating threads; thread types</h4>

...

<h4>Scheduling a thread</h4>

...

<h4>Listening for thread events</h4>

...

<h4>Note about how threads are scheduled, interrupted, and cancelled</h4>

<p>...</p>

<h3>Running scripts synchronously</h3>

<p>For special purposes it is sometimes desirable to run scripts
synchronously.  (Normally you really do not want to do this, so think
carefully.)  To do this, you need to create an execution context for
the script and run the script engine directly, bypassing the normal
scheduler. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The autoproxy module uses synchronous script execution (but
incorporates a time limit to prevent endless loops from hanging
Opera).  See the description of <a href="proxy-determination.html">the
Proxy Determination design</a>.


<h3>Destroying scripts</h3>

<p>Compiled scripts must be destroyed explicitly when they are no longer
used. ...</p>

<h2>Modules affected</h2>

<p>The ECMAScript scheduler is defined in the module ecmascript_utils
and the ECMAScript engine is defined in the module ecmascript.  The
logdoc module calls the engine to compile scripts, while the doc
module calls the scheduler to handle events.  The autoproxy and java
modules both call the ecmascript module to compile and run
scripts.</p>

<p>... (Async interface; and does the Java module use the scheduler?)</p>


<h2>Critique and history</h2>

<p>The current design is the second generation and was introduced in
Opera 7.  It came about as a result of the old design's inability to
mimic the scheduler semantics of MSIE and Mozilla (neither of which
has timeslicing) and the difficulty of dealing with blocking and
suspension in that scheduler.</p>
