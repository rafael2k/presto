<h1>Opera Core from the outside</h1>

<p>$Id$</p>

<p>This document describes the common controlled API to the core code
of Opera.  Its intended audience is members of the Opera engineering
department.</p>

<h2>The Core API defines the Opera core</h2>

<p>The Core API consists of a description of what the core does, plus
code to access or activate that functionality.  (See a separate
section below for many more details.)  Its purpose is to make most
platform and customer requirements to the core visible in three ways:
<ul>
<li> as code that is visible in the API;
<li> as core-internal features that can be turned on and off in a
configuration file; or
<li> as operational requirements on the core code.  
</ul>
In particular, platform and customer requirements are no longer met by
platform-group authored and owned code embedded inside the core code.
Instead, to the greatest extent possible the requirements on the core
are explicit, so that the core code does not meet them by accident,
but by design; and all core code is controlled by the core group.</p>

<h2>Block diagram</h2>

<p>The following block diagram shows our working model of the view of
the Core code from the outside.  It is probably not complete, but it
covers a large number of cases.  Explanations to the various boxes
follow below.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Core</b> 
<dd>The big box in the middle (with external APIs represented by "Core
Utils", "Core API upward", "Core API downward", and "Featurettes")
represents the core code.

<dt><b>Major interfaces</b>
<dd>Core exports an API upward to the user interface, this consists of
WindowCommander and Preferences.  It also exports an API downward to
the platform support code, this consists of PortingInterfaces (which
must be instantiated) and Preferences.

<dt><b>Auxiliary interfaces ("Featurettes")</b> 
<dd>Core also exports special APIs directly to "customer" code, for
example, JavaScript plugins and the Voice APIs.  These featurettes are
not related to porting Opera to a new platform but rather allow
customer add-ins.

<dt><b>Utility code</b>
<dd> In addition, both kinds of platform code may rely on the Core
Utilities functionality, a random collection of support code that does
not have anything to do with browsing per se but may provide string,
numeric, unicode, etc functionality.

<dt><b>Features</b>
<dd> The functionality in the Core, and sometimes aspects of the Core
APIs, are controlled through a feature system that enable and disable
various parts of the Core code.

</dl>

<p>It is probable that not all of Opera as it is now is representable
in this architecture, so the drawing may change (or Opera may change).
One example is Opera initialization: it does not obviously belong in
WindowCommander or PortingInterfaces; and initialization order differs
on different platforms, with platform code sometimes being initialized
after some core pieces are ready but before others.</p>


<h2>What is really the Core API?</h2>

<p>It is the code we produce that we sell, but the core API is mostly
<em>not</em> about code.  Instead it is about structures that support
the development of a reliable product, or in this case, a reliable
core component.</p>

<p>The Core API consists of at least these following parts.  Note that
one can make each of these arbitrarily complex; we aim to make them
light-weight.  (We have code to write.)</p>

<h3>Interfaces: WindowCommander, Prefs, Util, and Featurettes.</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Classes, methods, and constants.</em> Defined in header files.  
Documentation for these aspects is covered by the following section.

<li><em>Supported Core FEATURES.</em> Defined in 
<a type="text/plain" href="../../../core/vfunc.h">core/vfunc.h</a> 
and documented in <a href="../../../core/vfunc.txt">core/vfunc.txt</a>.

<li> <em><a href="envelope-of-change.html#soft">Assumptions the core
code makes about the platform.</a></em> These are things that can be
fixed if they turn out not to be true, but doing so may require
substantial work.

</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>

<li> <em><a href="../index.html">Metadocumentation and a map.</a></em> You're reading it.

<li> <em>Interface documentation.</em>  Mainly this is split into two parts:
<ul>
<li> Structural documentation is textual (HTML) and graphical (UML).  Documentation 
is kept with the code and can/will be extracted onto the intranet automatically.
<li> Each class, method, and constant is also documented doxygen-style in the code.  
This too can/will be extracted onto the intranet.
</ul>
<li> <em><a href="tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>, examples, FAQs.</em>  Some of this may be placed on the Wiki.
<li> <em><a href="design-principles.html">Design principles.</a></em>
</ul>

<h3>Non-interface aspects of the core code</h3>
<ul>
<li> <em><a href="envelope-of-change.html">Envelope of change.</a></em>  These are the 
hard architectural constraints of the core code.  
<li> <em><a href="specifications.html">Specifications.</a></em>  These are the things the
core code should do or conform to that do not show up in interfaces, per se.
<li> <em>Information.</em>  This could be things like lists of the compilers we 
know we have used; 3rd party modules we use.
</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
<li> <em>Change requests.</em>  How/when are requirements/needs communicated to the 
core; how do we implement them in a timely manner; etc.
<li> <em>Principles for what we do.</em>
<ul>
<li>One principle is that requirements are to be communicated as functional 
requirements, not as code.  Of course, code may be enclosed as a prototype
implementation, but code does not constitute a requirement.
</ul>
<li> <em>How to track bugs.</em>  The BTS is not a very good fit with our new 
module/product structure.  This needs to be worked out.
<li> <em>Release process.</em>  Core will become a versioned product, with bug 
fixes and so on.
<li> <em>Support.</em>  Call +47 2416 4063, $10/minute.  (Just joking.)
</ul>

<h3>Core code</h3>
<ul>
<li> The canonical core implementation
<li> Selftest
<li> Testsuites
<li> Maybe dummy implementations of various interfaces to ease testing and porting
</ul>
