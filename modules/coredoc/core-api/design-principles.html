<h1>Core API: Design Principles</h1>

<p>$Id$</p>

<p>(not much here yet) The only thing right now that qualifies as a
principle is that core-to-platform communication upward goes via
listeners, and ditto downward goes via virtual method calls.  That's a
general statement, other methods of interaction may in fact be in use
or desirable.  It may also be that Opera would prefer communication
from the platform code up into the porting interface to be via
listeners.</p>
