<p>$Id$</p>

<h2>Web standards supported by the Core</h2>

<p>The following list needs to list all standards we say we support,
and outline how well we actually support them.</p>

<p>This list is presumably quite long; it should include things like 
support for various encoding schemes, character sets, bidi, ...</P>

<dl>
<dt><b>HTML 4.01</b>
<dt><b>XHTML 1.0</b>
<dt><b>XML x.y</b>
<dt><b>CSS 2.0</b>
<dt><b>CSS 2.1</b>
<dt><b>DOM 2 Core</b>
<dt><b>DOM 2 HTML</b>
<dt><b>DOM 2 Event</b>
<dt><b>ECMAScript v3.0</b>
<dt><b>ECMAScript v3.0 Compact Profile</b>
<dt><b>ECMAScript v3.0 Mobile Profile</b>
<dt><b>JavaScript 1.3</b>

<h2>Non-web functionality supported by the core</h2>

Usually these are major components that are controlled by FEATURES.

<h2>Other requirements</h2>

<p>Many things here.</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>Leak-free</b>
<dd>

<dt><b>Out-of-memory handling (I)</b>
<dd>On a platform where the Operating System and vendor libraries
reliably handle and report out-of-memory conditions, Opera will always
handle and report the condition as well, and will continue to operate
(though perhaps with reduced functionality) after the condition.

<dt><b>Limited-memory operation</b>
<dd>
</dl>


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

Enumeration of stuff we do support even if there might not be a requirement, 
eg various <u>opera:</u> URLs, .ini-settings.
