<p><a href="api/index.html">Opera debug module documentation</a>

<p>(The documentation for the debug module is now completely contained
in the source code in doxygen format. Run <code>doxygen</code> in the
<code>modules/debug/documentation/</code> directory to create the
documentation if it does not exist.</p>

<p>Alternatively, have a look in <a href="http://whorl/~eddy/doc/modules/debug/documentation/api/index.html">Eddy's doxygenification of debug module</a>.

<h2>Tracing with <code>OP_DBG</code></h2>

<p>Note: This section to be moved</p>

<p> Tracing is provided for by the <code>OP_NEW_DBG(<i>function-name</i>,
key)</code> and <code>OP_DBG(("fmt", &hellip;))</code> macros.  In non-debug
builds, the former declares an object and the latter calls a method on that
object if the <code>key</code> is listed in your configuration file. </p>

<p> The configuration file is specified by passing it as the parameter to
<code>Debug::InitSettings</code> during Opera initialization.  Lines in it which
start with a <code>#</code> character are comments (note that a <code>#</code>
elsewhere in the line has no special meaning).  Other non-empty lines either set
one of a small family of pre-defined variables (mostly toggles taking value
<code>on</code> or <code>off</code>) or name a <code>key</code> whose tracing
statements are to be active.  For example: </p> <pre>

# lines with first character # are comments
# some global settings you might want:
output=opdebug.out
clearfile=on
debugging=on
#tracing=on
#timing=on
#timestamp=on
#systemdebug=on
#console=on

# key values from OP_NEW_DBG(function, key) you want to exercise:
debug_gif_decoder
#voice
#util.adt
mail.engine.protocol
animation
DOM3LS
# A single '*' on a line by itself enables all keys; i.e. everything is logged
# *
</pre>
