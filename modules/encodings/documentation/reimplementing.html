 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  For platforms with specific footprint requirements, you may want to
  re-implement the converter code.
  By setting <code>FEATURE_TABLEMANAGER</code> to <code>NO</code> you can
  remove the code for the internal converters that are table-driven.
  A few algorithmic converters will still be included,
  <a href="#suppliedconverters">please see below</a>.
 </p>

 <h2 id="factories">Factories</h2>
 <p>
  When disabling support for the table driven converters, the default
  factories will be disabled, which means that you will need to implement
  them for your platform.
  There are two factories:
  <code>InputConverter::CreateCharConverter_real()</code> creates instance of
  <code>InputConverter</code>, i.e decoders, and
  <code>OutputConverter::CreateCharConverter()</code> creates instance of
  <code>OutputConverter</code>, i.e encoders.
 </p>

 <h3 id="assumptions">Special assumptions</h3>
 <p>
  The Opera core code assumes that when it requests a <em>decoder</em> for
  <code>iso-8859-1</code> it does instead get one for
  <code>windows-1252</code>, as there are several web sites that are
  mislabeled.
  However, when requesting an <em>encoder</em> for <code>iso-8859-1</code>,
  it must receive such an encoder, and not the 1252 variant.
 </p>

 <p>
  The decoder for <code>UTF-8</code> must support passing <code>NULL</code>
  as the destination buffer parameter, and then return the number of bytes
  needed to perform the conversion.
  The Opera core implementation for <code>UTF-8</code> does this, and it is
  <a href="#suppliedconverters">recommended that this implementation is
  used</a>.
 </p>

 <h3 id="quirks">Implemented quirks</h3>
 <p>
  See the
  <a href="http://wiki.oslo.opera.com/developerwiki/index.php/Encodings_module">Wiki page</a>
  for various other quirks that are implemented in the Opera encodings
  support, together with the reasoning behind them.
  It should not be necessary to mimic most of those in re-implementations.
 </p>

 <h2 id="implementingconverters">Implementing converters</h2>
 <p>
  For best results, the platform converters should be forgiving for input
  errors, as Opera will most certainly encounter pages with mis-identified
  encodings, or containing garbage data.
  Opera converters never throw exceptions (leave) or give up when encountering
  faulty data, they simply flag these conversion errors using the internal
  APIs and continue as if nothing happened.
  Since it is the converters themselves that have knowledge on what proper
  data would look like, they are much better at performing error-recovery
  than the client code.
 </p>

 <h3 id="apireqs">API requirements</h3>
 <p>
  Converters inherit from the generic <code>CharConverter</code> interface
  via <code>InputConverter</code> and <code>OutputConverter</code> classes.
  Because their fields of use are slightly different, the set of additional
  APIs differ between them.
 </p>

 <h3 id="converterreqs">What Opera assumes from converters</h3>
 <p>
  To properly support <code>FEATURE_USE_ENTITIES_IN_FORMS</code> or
  <code>API_ENC_UNCONVERTIBLE</code>, your encoders will need
  to identify missing codepoints and to signal them  using the proper APIs.
  For stateful encodings, you will need to switch back to ASCII before
  outputting an entity.
  The feature can safely be turned off if you do not support it; using entities
  in forms is a non-standard extension.
  Care must be taken to support the reporting of unconvertible characters, as
  this might be enabled by enabling other features or tweaks.
  It is known to be imported by API_XMLUTILS_XMLTOSTRINGSERIALIZER and Opera
  Mail.
 </p>

 <h2 id="suppliedconverters">Supplied converters</h2>
 <p>
  No matter what, the encodings will supply converters for converting from
  and to <code>ISO 8859-1</code>, <code>UTF-8</code> and <code>UTF-16</code>.
  There is also an implementation of <code>UTF-7</code> that will be included
  if the corresponding <code>API_ENC_UTF7</code> is enabled (please note that
  <code>UTF-7</code> is not used on web pages, but may still be used in email
  and other contexts).
  All these conversions are pure algorithmic, and are the recommended
  converters for use even when platform converters are used.
