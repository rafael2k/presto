Known things to do:

* Missing implementations

    - (none at this time)

* Known bugs

    - Math libary good enough? https://bugs.opera.com/browse/CORE-5285

* Open correctness issues

    - printf and scanf are not completely C99-conformant at this time.
      we currently require comformance for snprintf (return values), which
      could cause problems for platform libraries that are not compliant.

    - How good is op_mktime?  It passes the tests in hardcore, but they're not
      very severe.

    - Do we need to support NEED_GUARD_AGAINST_NAN?

* Third-party code issues

    - would be nice to reimplement printf and scanf to get rid of the
      third-party code for those, but not critical.

    - would be nice to be able to compile without thirdparty printf/scanf
      when we have platform implementations thereof.

* sscanf: document nonrecognized formats (like %jd/%zd/%td) and examine it for
  other limitations relative to C99.

* Write more documentation: for many standard functions it might be useful
  to include the spec in opera_stdlib.h, notably the return value

* Unable to get doxygen to produce information for static inline functions.

* Go through the C standard to see if there's anything obvious we might
  be supporting, and document in the header file which functions or
  macros that might be (like for strtok).

* Rewrite op_gmtime to use new date library?

* Move date library to util module?

* Move bitvector library to util module?

* uni_strchr() and others return const uni_char pointers in C++, not
  in C (MSVC6, possibly others)
