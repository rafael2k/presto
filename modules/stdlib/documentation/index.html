<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p><code>stdlib</code> is an implementation of all the C standard
library functions used by Opera, with names prefixed by "<code>op_</code>", eg,
"<code>op_memcpy</code>".</p>

<p>It also contains implementations of the corresponding Unicode
versions, prefixed by "<code>uni_</code>", and a few mixed-representation
versions, also prefixed "<code>uni_</code>" but with different signatures.</p>

<p>Finally, it contains some locally concocted Unicode utility
functions.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>We want our own implementations of these functions to use on
platforms where the platform implementation is not good enough or is
missing.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>The implementation should meet the following requirements:</p>
<dl>

<dt>Portable</dt>

<dd><p>Functions should be platform-independent when possible and
    should use the standard porting interfaces to achieve this.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Standards-conforming</dt>

<dd><p>The implementation should follow the C standard closely; any
    deviations must explicitly be deemed unimportant, and the
    deviations must be documented.  Deviations are strongly
    discouraged.</p>
</dd>

<dt>High quality</dt>

<dd><p>Correctness, performance and memory use must be excellent.
    Footprint is also important, but less important than the previous
    three.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Unencumbered</dt>

<dd><p>Third-party code is allowed, but should be avoided if possible,
    and should always be visible.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="apidocumentation">API documentation</h2>

<p>
The
<abbr title="Application programming interface">API</abbr>
<a href="api/index.html">is documented using Doxygen, here</a>.
Most of the API consists of functions defined by the C and C++ standards,
but there are also some utility classes both used internally and available
for other modules.
</p>

<h2 id="implementationnote">Implementation notes</h2>

<p>Note that the source code for some of the string functions is
defined in an include file that is included multiple times into
<code>src/stdlib_string.cpp</code> to generate various versions.  See
more documentation in that file.</p>

<p>
Some of the functionality does require access to information from
the porting interfaces to function correctly.
Thus you cannot, for instance, implement
<code>OpSystemInfo::GetTimezone</code> using the stdlib module
implementation of <code>op_localtime()</code>, as the latter will call the
former.
</p>

<p>
If the third-party <code>dtoa</code> library is disabled
(<strong>note:</strong> this is strongly discouraged),
The stdlib module will export an additional porting interface that the
platform must implement.
This porting interface is defined by the class
<a href="api/classStdlibPI.html">StdlibPI</a>, defined in the file
<code><a href="../stdlib_pi.h">stdlib_pi.h</a></code>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="TODO">Some notes and ToDos</a>.

<h2 id="memorydocumentation">Memory documentation</h2>

<h3 id="oompolicies"><abbr title="Out of memory">OOM</abbr> Policies</h3>

<p>Standard C functions signal OOM by returning an error code and
setting <code>errno</code> to <code>ENOMEM</code>. The stdlib module always
returns an error code when it encounters OOM.  It will set
<code>errno</code> when it is available (<code>HAVE_ERRNO</code> is defined).</p>

<p>If <code>errno</code> is not available, OOM is therefore not
signalled reliably by this module: clients cannot always tell OOM from
other errors.</p>

<h3 id="whoishandlingoom">Who is handling OOM</h3>

<p>The module frees internal storage.  The client code is responsible
for freeing storage it owns.</p>

<h3 id="descriptionofflow">Description of flow</h3>

<p>Most of this module consists of separate functions used separately,
so there are no "flow" issues.  The exception is the thirdparty
number-to-string and string-to-number functions in
the <code>OpDoubleFormat</code> interface and <code>op_strtod()</code>,
and the thirdparty random number generator.  These have internal state and
some working storage.  This memory is allocated either at startup or
on demand, and deallocated when the module is destroyed at
shutdown.</p>

<h3 id="heapmemoryusage">Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>None of the functions use much heap memory at all.</p>

<p>The thirdparty number-to-string and string-to-number functions can
use some, but maintain an internal free list, so the pressure on the
memory allocator is slight.</p>

<p>The bitmap structure used by <code>op_scanf()</code> for tracking
character sets can become large if large ranges of Unicode characters
are used, but this does not usually happen.</p>

<h3 id="stackmemoryusage">Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>None of the functions in the module use more than a few stack frames, and
generally avoid stack-allocated buffers.</p>

<h3 id="staticmemoryusage">Static memory usage</h3>

<p>The thirdparty number-to-string and string-to-number functions and
the thirdparty random number generator (RGN) have some global data.
Not all of these data are allocated at startup.  The number-to-string
and string-to-number functions may use an unbounded amount of memory
(in exceptional cases) and will maintain an internal free list of
unused storage that won't be cleared until Opera shuts down and is
therefore "static".  The RNG has about 3KB of internal state.</p>

<h3 id="cachingandfreeingmemory">Caching and freeing memory</h3>

<p>The thirdparty number-to-string and string-to-number functions will
return their internal storage if the <code>FreeCachedData()</code> API
is called on the <code>StdlibModule</code> object.
</p>

<h3 id="freeingmemoryonexit">Freeing memory on exit</h3>

<p>All static data are freed on exit as long as the module's
<code>Destroy()</code> method is called.</p>

<h3 id="tempbuffers">Temp buffers</h3>

<p>The module uses <code>MemoryManager::TempBufferUni</code> for the macros and
functions that convert single-byte to unicode and vice versa.  It does
not use any of the other tempbuffers.</p>

<h3 id="memorytuning">Memory tuning</h3>

<p>There is no way to tune the memory usage of the module.</p>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<p>There are no provided tests for memory use or leaks.</p>

<h3 id="coverage">Coverage</h3>

<p>
The selftest suite contains base-line tests for the entire public API of
the module, and more in-depth tests for some of the functionality.
</p>

<p>Running the selftest suite and loading a fairly complex page like
vg.no, followed perhaps by running the ECMAScript test suite, is
expected to give reasonable coverage.  This has not actually been
verified.</p>

<h3 id="designchoices">Design choices</h3>

<p>The third-party random number generator was not chosen for having the
smallest internal state, it (the Mersenne Twister RNG) was chosen
because it is generally acknowledged as being the best, and as being
fast.</p>

<h3 id="suggestionsforimprovements">Suggestions for improvements</h3>

<h4 id="oomhandling">OOM handling</h4>

<p>There should be reliable OOM tracking.  The most attractive
solution is to implement <code>errno</code> ourselves if the platform
does not; however, <code>errno</code> will still not be set by the
platform functions in that case, so it is still not a perfect
solution.</p>
