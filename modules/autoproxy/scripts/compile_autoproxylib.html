 ECMAScript autoproxy library precompiler
 Lars T Hansen

 This is an infrastructure for translating ECMAScript library
 functions, written in ECMAScript, into a C program that efficiently
 recreates the compiled form of the functions.

 We define a bunch of functions which will later be installed in their
 various prototype objects in a running Opera.  For example, in the
 file string_lib.js there is a function string_prototype_replace(),
 which ends up installed as String.prototype.replace().
 
 (These functions are mostly clean ECMAScript, so it is possible to
 set up a simple test environment for them so that they can be tested
 before they are installed in the browser.)

 We then load the present document into a browser.  It runs the
 disassembler on each function and generates the C code, which it
 prints in the browser window.

 We copy the generated code into the file es_library.cpp in the
 ECMAScript engine source code (just replace the entire file contents
 with those generated by the present document).
