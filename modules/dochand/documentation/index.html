 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
   The dochand module contains important classes such as
   
     <code>WindowManager</code>,
     <code>Window</code>,
     <code>DocumentManager</code> and
     <code>FramesDocElm</code>.

   It needs to have better documentation written.
 </p>

 <h2>WindowManager</h2>
 <p>
   The class

     <code>WindowManager</code>

   essentially keeps track of all open windows, from Core's
   perspective.  (A window, from Core's perspective, might be
   something that isn't really a window as such in somebody else's
   perspective; such as a the contents of a popup dialog, e-mail
   message or a side-bar panel.)

   It also has various functions for handling windows and to open
   URL:s in a window, in another (named) window, or in a newly opened
   window.
 </p>

 <h2>Window</h2>
 <p>
  The class

    <code>Window</code>

  represents an open window, from Core's perspective (see above.)  It
  keeps track available history positions and the currently active
  history position as numbers (min, max and current) and also keeps
  track of various window-level information.  Apart from this, it
  doesn't really do much, normally.  
 </p>

 <h2>DocumentManager</h2>
 <p>
  The class

    <code>DocumentManager</code>

  handles loading of URL:s, creation of documents when loading the
  right kind of URL:s, and history.  There is one top-level document
  manager in each Core window, and further one document manager in
  each FRAME and IFRAME in a document.
 </p>

 <h3>History</h3>
 <p>
  History, as handled by a document manager, is a list of object of
  the small utility class

    <code>DocListElm</code>.

  Each DocListElm represents a history position, and knows the number
  of that history position.  The history list in each document manager
  is "sparse," that is, it doesn't necesserily contain one element for
  each history number in the range defined by the window.  When no
  element directly represents a given history number, the element used
  for that history number is the element number having the highest
  number smaller than that history number.
 </p>

 <p>
  Each DocListElm has a reference the document that should be
  displayed when that history element is activated, and how the
  document was scrolled.  Several consecutive history elements may
  reference the same document at different scroll positions.  This
  occurs when the links to anchors in the document are followed.
 </p>

 <h2>FramesDocElm</h2>
 <p>
  The class

    <code>FramesDocElm</code>

  represents a FRAMESET, FRAME or IFRAME element.  The ones
  representing FRAMESET elements are mostly just used to layout frames
  and to hold references to the child FRAME elements.  Also, there is
  one FramesDocElm object that simply acts as the parent of all
  FramesDocElm objects representing IFRAME elements in a document.  A
  FramesDocElm object owns a document manager, which in turn manages
  the document displayed in that FRAME or IFRAME.
