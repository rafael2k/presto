/** \mainpage Search Engine
 *
 * This module's purpose is to offer general indexing and searching services.
 * There are two basic methods for indexing: ACTs and B-trees. ACT is suitable
 * for variable-size keys, UTF-8 strings in particular. BTree is suited for
 * fixed-size keys, like integers, dates etc.
