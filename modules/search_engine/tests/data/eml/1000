Elliot,

Look in the bbvar/histlogs directory and find the name 
of the client.  It's most likely in a different case. 
If you keep an eye on the bb2.html, new status updates 
will show up there, and the clients may not always 
look as you have expected.  You can always force them 
to one case or the other by putting something in the 
BBALIASNAME field.  I think it's just above the name 
of the workstation on the client config app.
