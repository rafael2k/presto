Dear BroSis,

Running v19c.

I am probably missing something obvious, but I have some scripts that return a greater number of lines than the display is prepared to handle. When the service is selected, the page displays a set number of lines of outout and then I get "...DATA TRUNCATED..." at the bottom.

I grep'd for TRUNCATED in bin and found it in bbd.  I don't see it as a compile time flag -- is it set elsewhere?

Any clues appreciated.

Robert Ruork
