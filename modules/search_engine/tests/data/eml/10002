I removed cont2.sh from bb-bbext, as well as fping, figuring they are 
both built in.
This made both content and fping go purple.
If I put them back, I get cont working, as well as fping, but still have 
the red content column.
According to the docs, content should work just like cont2.sh, but it 
doesnt seem to.
What else can I check?
