Well, sorta... if they are providing income for the person monitoring
(getting paid by a client for monitoring) then the license isn't free.

If one hasn't already looked, http://bb4.com/license.html has several

Actually, if the systems are not being used for generating income like
in ISP, than the license is free.  This includes development, test and
back - office production servers.
