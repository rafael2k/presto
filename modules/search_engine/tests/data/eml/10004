Well I didn't read all of it. However we suspect memory troubles on some of
our servers,  so you might wanna check if your memory is bad.
http://www.memtest86.com/ has a neat little utility/bootdisk to check. Also
in l/unix OSes, all the memory gets used for buffering, so its normal. There
is a way to see how much actual memory is in use. I think its "Memory - Free
Memory - Buffered Memory". I don't think its a BB thing if the box is
completly hanging though, so give memtest86 a whirl.
