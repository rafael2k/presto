There is no message in the event log stating "started" during the reboot,
only the stopped message.  The only started message come from me manually
starting the service.

Thanks for you help on this!

in the event log,is there a message that says "started" just before the
"stopped" message, if so is the "started" message timestamped with the
server reboot ?
