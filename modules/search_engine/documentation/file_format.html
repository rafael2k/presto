<h1>Format of files for indexing/searching</h1>
<p>This document describes the binary file formats introduced with Opera
version 9 for various files used for indexing/searching. 
</p>
<p>The new format of these files is based on dividing files into blocks
of same size. The blocks for one record might be chained if the size of one
block isn't enough for the record. This way it's easy to perform transactions
on the files.
</p>
<p>The format is NOT backwards compatible with any previous Opera versions.
Conversions to the new format are performed after an update from an old
version.
</p>

<h2>Format in General</h2>
<p>Files consist of chained blocks of the same size. The first block contains
headers. Structure of the first block is:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>8B</td>
		<td>pointer to the first free block or 0 if there isn't any
            free block</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4B</td>
		<td>3154051328, magical number used for identification of the file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4B</td>
		<td>size of the blocks</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>optional headers may follow</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The other blocks may either contain valid data or they may be empty. The
last block is never empty. Their structure is:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>8B</td>
		<td>pointer to the next block or 0 if this is the last block
		    in the chain</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4B/0B</td>
		<td>size of the current record, this field is present only in the 
            first block of the chain</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td>data follow</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>.act files</h2>
<p>These files contain words and with pointers to to .bt files. The records
in them are of fixed size, they always fit to one block. The record is an array
of fields. The structure of the field is in table bellow.
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>4B/8B</td>
		<td>pointer to the next record (one of DiskChild or MemoryChild is
            set) or offset (both flags DiskChild and MemoryChild are 0) in the 
            current record</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2B</td>
		<td>flags and parent of the current node;
			value parent is 0 if the parent is in another branch;
			bits for flags are:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>15</td>
					<th>Final</th>
					<td>this node doesn't have any children</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>14</td>
					<th>IsWord</th>
					<td>characters up to this one are an indexed word</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>13</td>
					<th>MemoryChild</th>
					<td>not used on disk</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>12</td>
					<th>DiskChild</th>
					<td>pointer is a branch number</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>11</td>
					<th>Free</th>
					<td>this node is unsused</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4B</td>
		<td>word ID, valid if flag IsWord is set</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The first field of the array contains number of not free fields in its word
ID part and the rest of it is unused.
</p>
<p>There is an optional header at offset 16. Its size is 19*4B. It is used to
save a status of a generator of pseudo-random numbers.
</p>
<h2>.bt files</h2>
<p>These files contain BTrees of file IDs containing the appropriate word. The
word ID from ACT is a number of the first block in a chain of file IDs for the
word. File IDs are 32 bit integers.
The block structure contains 32 bit number of the rightmost child followed by
pairs of file ID and pointer to its left child. The pointers to children are
positions of the children in the file divided by size of the blocks.
</p>
<p>There are several BTrees in the file. There is no indication of roots, but
the roots are pointed from the .act.
