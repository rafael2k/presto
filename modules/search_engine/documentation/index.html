<h1>Search Engine</h1>
<p>The purpose of Search Engine is to perform fulltext and other indexing and
searching. Indexes are disk-based with focus on low memory usage, speed and
crash-safety. Use cases inlude m2 indexing, cache management or a fulltext
history search.
</p>
<p>Some of the classes can be used separately for other purposes, for
example TVector, BlockStorage or WordSegmenter.
</p>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>The diagram bellow shows the general structure of this module. See
<a href="api/index.html">doxygen generated documentation</a> for details or
<a href="#examples">examples in chapter 4</a>.
<img src="classes.gif" alt="class diagram">
</p>
<p>Every class has its appropriate .ot file.
Unlike some other code, OP_ASSERTs aren't placed on unnecessary places,
so whenever you see an assertion, it's a serious problem. Please report it to
the module owner.
</p>
<h3>class BlockStorage</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_block_storage.html">BlockStorage</a> is a crash-safe file encapsulation with transaction support.
File is divided into blocks of same size. The details of the block handling
are transparent to user, but it's suitable to choose block size close to the
size of the stored records. If the size of the block is too big, you loose
disk space, if the size of the block is too small, you loose performance. If
the record is too big to fit into one block, the blocks are chained.
The first block with offset 0 is reserved for internal usage, so the first
valid block is the second one. Each block contains a 64 bit pointer to the next
block, the first block in this chain also contains a 32 bit length of the data.
The reserved block at offset 0 contains a 64 bit pointer to the first free
block, 32 bit header and 32 bit size of a block. It may also contain user
header data.
</p>
<h3>template class TVector</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_t_vector.html">TVector</a> is to a big extent compatible with OpVector. In addition, it can
also hold non-pointer types like integers or structures an provides methods
for sorting and searching in the sorted vector.
</p>
<h3>class ACT</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_a_c_t.html">ACT</a> is a shortcut of Array Compacted Trie. Trie is an array of pointers
indexed by appropriate character from a word. Each pointer points to array for
next character. See
<a href="http://www.n3labs.com/pdf/fast-and-space-efficient.pdf">
http://www.n3labs.com/pdf/fast-and-space-efficient.pdf</a>
for more information about ACTs. The main advantage is that the search time
doesn't depend on the size of indexed data.
</p>
<p>class ACT is used for storing words and IDs of the words. It's possible to
delete words from ACT, but you have to know the word you are going to delete.
ACT is built on the top of BlockStorage.
</p>
<h3>class SingleBTree</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_single_b_tree.html">SingleBTree</a> is a multiway search tree, B-tree, stored on disk.
</p>
<h4>class TBtree</h4>
<p><a href="api/class_t_b_tree.html">TBtree</a> is obtained via class TPool, which serves as a storage for
multiple B-trees in one file.
</p>
<h3>class StringTable</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_string_table.html">StringTable</a> looks up files contating a given word. It consists of two parts,
ACT and DiskBTree, stored in files .act and .bt.
ACT contains the words with pointers to DiskBTree. Each word is stored
once for all the files together. Every DiskBTree contains file IDs of the files
containing the word.
</p>
<h3>class BSCursor</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_b_s_cursor.html">BSCursor</a> uses BlockStorage to store structured records. Items in the record
can have both fixed an varibale length.
</p>
<h3>class WordSegmenter</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_word_segmenter.html">WordSegmenter</a> divides plain text into separate words. It contains a
recognition of email addresses and URLs as well. Bigrams and trigrams are
returned for scripts without spaces between words, such as Chinese.
</p>
<h3>class VisitedSearch</h3>
<p><a href="api/class_visited_search.html">VisitedSearch</a> is an implementation of Google-like fulltext searching and
indexing, returning URLs with other metadata as a result of a search query.
</p>
<h4>struct RankIndex</h4>
<p>RankIndexes manages index files holding part of the fulltext index.
VisitedSearch index consists of several such subindexes.
</p>

<h2>Memory usage</h2>
<h3>OOM policy</h3>
<p>The vast majority of methods returns OP_STATUS to signal OOM. An exception
is SearchIterator, which uses its method Error to signal OOM.
</p>
<h3>OOM handling</h3>
<p>Generally all errors, including OOM, are propagated to calling layer. When
OOM happens in ACT or DiskBTree, the class tries firstly to solve the problem
by cleaning its internal cache.
</p>
<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>
<p>The indexes are disk-based, so they don't require a lot of memory 
except <a href="#caches">caches</a>.
The caches can be reduced by tweaks on a limited memory device.
</p>
<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>
<p>The stack is used moderately, but there are recursive functions in ACT and BTree.
The recursion in BTree isn't so deep, but it might make problems in ACT for
long strings (e.g. URLs) during prefix searching. The limit is 100 
recursive calls.
</p>
<a name="caches"></a>
<h3>Caches</h3>
<p>There are caches in VisitedSearch, StringTable, ACT and BTreePool.
The caches in VisitedSearch and StringTable are freed explicitly by calling Commit.
The cache in ACT and BTreePool, descendants of BSCache, is handled 
internally. If these classes were used directly, their cache can be freed by calling
Flush.
</p>
<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
<p>It's possible to change the maximum size of ACT and BTreePool caches.
However, it is not recommended, since the current sizes come from a numeber experiments.
</p>
<h2>ACT implementation</h2>
<p>When indexing or searching for a word, the root TrieBranch is loaded at
first. Branch is an array of TrieNodes. The TrieNodes are indexed by characters
of the word. So you take the first character and go to characterth position
in the root TrieBranch. The TrieNode on this position contains information
where to go with the next character. It might point to another branch. In this
case you load the branch and repeat the process. The TrieNode for next
character might also lay in the same branch. In this case, you read on offset
from the current TrieNode and add this offset to the next character to find out
the position. Some of the TrieNodes might be free. It means that no word with
character appropriate for the position have been indexed. The number of the
free nodes is about 60% in average.
