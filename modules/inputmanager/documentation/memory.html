<h2>Used OOM policies</h2>
Softcore will usually return OP_STATUS, except for functions calling lots of functions that LEAVE, where the functions in Softcore also will Leave (to avoid lots of TRAPs)

<h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>
Softcore will do its best to stay in a consistent state, and not leak memory already allocated in case of OOM. Caller should always check for OpStatus::ERR_NO_MEMORY

<h2>Description of flow</h2>
-

<h2>Heap memory usage</h2>
Places where a large object is created often, is the OpInputActionObjects used in OpInputManager::InvokeAction and OpInputManager::InvokeActionInternal (pre-filter).

<h2>Stack memory usage</h2>
OpInputActions might be sent from input_context to its parent input_context (and then to its parent input context), but this will always be a finite, fairly small number of layers. There are no really recursive functions.

<h2>Static memory usage</h2>
-

<h2>Caching and freeing memory</h2>
-

<h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>
-

<h2>Temp buffers</h2>
No temp buffers are used by the inputmanager.

<h2>Memory tuning</h2>
-

<h2>Tests</h2>
-

<h2>Coverage</h2>
Run selftests in limited memory profiles.

<h2>Design choices</h2>
Some parts of the code does NOT have a design choice based on memory (most notably, OpInputManager and OpInputAction). Quite a few other parts are designed to load and keep data at startup, and save (if needed) and free data at shutdown. Depending on rate of access, data is either kept as compact as possible, or as quickly accessible as possible.

<h2>Suggestions of improvements</h2>
OpInputManager/OpInputAction should be made memory safe.
