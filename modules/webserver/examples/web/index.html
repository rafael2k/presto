<h1>Wild wild web!</h1>

<img src="operalogo.gif">
This site contains some examples of various uses of the web server.
This document (index.html) demonstrates serving of HTML and image
content; note also the favicon.</p>

<p>Some other examples:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Bookmarks

<dd><p>Click <a href="/bookmarks">here</a> to get a list of
published bookmarks from the server, as XML (looks better in Firefox
than in Opera).</p>

<p>Serving of bookmarks, contacts, and notes is supported directly by
the web server.</p>


<dt>Bookmarks, formatted

<dd><p>Click <a href="/bookmarks.html">here</a> to load a document
that uses DOM3 Load to retrieve the XML for the bookmarks list, and
present it as HTML.</p>


<dt>OperaShow remote control

<dd><p>In your server-enabled Opera, open
any document (an OperaShow presentation is best, but a long site will
be OK too), then in another browser open this document and press the
buttons below to page through the document from this browser.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
<input type=button value="First" onclick="window.location='/OperaShow?first'">
<input type=button value="Previous" onclick="window.location='/OperaShow?previous'">
<input type=button value="Next" onclick="window.location='/OperaShow?next'">
<input type=button value="Last" onclick="window.location='/OperaShow?last'"></p>

<p>(The browser showing the document to be paged must have the input
focus, so must therefore be on a different screen.  This is a
bug.)</p>

<p>OperaShow controls (really remote control by input events) is
supported directly by the web server.</p>


<dt>Trivial "CGI" script execution

<dd><p>Enter an expression here and press TAB: 
<input type=text onchange="javascript:window.location='/eval?'+this.value" />
The expression will be submitted to the server, evaluated, and a
result will be returned.</p>

<p>The evaluator is 4 lines of JavaScript that runs inside the Opera Web browser
and acts as a CGI script.</p>


<dt>Simple mail interaction/"form mail"

<dd><p>Fill in this form with a From: address that the server-enabled
browser knows about, a To: address, and a (short) message body, and
the server will send the mail for you.</p>

<p>
<form method=get action="/formmail">
From: <input type=text name="From" /><br>
To: <input type=text name="To" /><br>
Subject: <input type=text name="Subject" /><br>
Message: <input type=text name="Body" /><br>
<input type=submit value="Send it!" />
</form>

<p>The form mail program is 11 lines of JavaScript that runs inside
the Opera Web server and interacts with M2.</p>


<dt>Simple chat program

<dd><p>Click <a href="/chat.html">here</a> to
load the chat client (you must be running Opera 8 or some other
browser that supports DOM3&nbsp;Load).  If you get a friend
to join too, you can chat!</p>

<p>The chat server is 45 lines of JavaScript that runs inside the
Opera web server and maintains a data structure of messages.  The
clients poll the server periodically (but if they are running in a web
server enabled Opera, they could be told when new messages are
available).</p>


<dt>RSS aggregator

<dd><p>Click <a href="/rss" target="new">here</a> to popup a window
that will be fed HTML resulting from aggregating several RSS feeds.</p>

<p>The rss aggregator is a 150-line script running on the web server,
using DOM Load to download feeds.</P>


<dt>HTTP authentication

<dd><p>Click <a href="/private/private.html">here</a> to access a
document that requires a user name and a password (try "root" and
"qumquat").</a>


<dt>Inaccessible directories

<dd><p>Click <a href="/scripts/index.html">here</a> to access a
document that has been marked as private (it will be served as a blank
page).</p>
