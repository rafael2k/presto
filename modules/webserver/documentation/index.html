<dt><a href="rationale.html">Rationale for a web server: The two-way World-Wide Web</a>

<dd><p>The distinction between web server and web client has got to
    go.  The web needs to be two-way, with a server and the client the
    same application and a server on every machine.  This server must
    be extremely simple to use and it must support dynamic pages.</p>

<dt><a href="examples.html">Example applications of the two-way web</a>

<dd><p>Making every client a server opens up for many peer-to-peer type
    computations, and the ability to create simple dynamic pages easily
    is all that is required.</p>

<dd><p>A high-level design: mostly about how this functionality will appear
    to the Opera user.</p>
