<h1>The Two-Way World-Wide Web</h1>

<p>Fifteen years after its inception, the web is still one-way to a
large extent.  It is becoming affordable to host web sites with web
hotels or with ISPs, yet it is not straightforward or free to do it,
and most Internet users do not have a personal web site viewable by
other people [1].  When they do, these sites are updated with
difficulty and are generally completely static.  The technology to
make them dynamic is also difficult to master--usually requiring the
use of Perl, Java, Visual Basic, or sundry shell languages.</p>

<p>It is time to fix this, and Opera is in a position to fix it.  I
propose to add a web server to Opera (for static and dynamic content).
Obviously one could add a server application to the system instead of
adding a web server to Opera, but the reason for doing it inside Opera
is that Opera already has a large following, and many of our users
will be tempted to try the Web server when it is already there and
easily accessible.  If we make it easy and useful, it will be
used.</p>


<h2>Simple web servers</h2>

<p>The web first of all needs a simple solution for serving pages from
home computers.  Apple has gone some way in this direction with its
"Personal web sharing" technology, built on Apache.  On a machine
running MacOS&nbsp;X, simply start personal web sharing and point
Apache to the right directory, and you're set.  There is a GUI for
this, and it is easy to do.</p>

<p>Apple's solution neglects the fact that most users do not in fact
have their own domain names and instead use DHCP to get internet
addresses.  It also does not do much for most people, since most
people run Windows, not MacOS&nbsp;X.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that Opera should rectify this problem in the
Windows world (and on desktops in general).  We are in a position to
do so in a simple way, and we should start by following Apple's
example and make it simple, above all.  Starting our web server is
easy: open the preferences panel, click "turn on web sharing", fill in
the name of the root directory on the local system from which files
should be served, and you're done.  The computer now has an HTTP
server, serving the owner's personal web site.</p>

<p>But we must also solve the problem of finding these sites.  Opera,
the company, should provide a service whereby an Opera user can
register (somehow, and for very little or no money) and will receive a
host name for himself in the opera.com domain.  Say I am lucky and I
get to use the name 'lth.users.opera.com' for my computer.  When I
start my web-server enabled copy of Opera, it will contact Opera's
name servers and tell them that right now, lth.opera.com has address
82.124.12.73.  (This is just dynamic DNS; others do it too.)  Anyone
wanting to view my web site looks for it on
http://lth.users.opera.com.  If my computer is up, the site is served.
(If it is down -- too bad).</p>

<p>A different possible solution is to forward
http://users.opera.com/lth to my site, but it is less elegant and will
suddenly expose the temporary IP number to the user agent.  To fix
this, users.opera.com would have to behave as a proxy, and though we
are in the proxy business a little bit, I don't know if we want to
take this on for the desktop market as well.</p>


<h2>Why "servers" and "clients", anyway?</h2>

<p>The web is divided into servers, which serve content, and clients,
which access content and display it.  (There are also proxies.)
Servers also process complex requests for information, for example
turning a web query into a database query and formatting the query
results into static HTML for display.  As suggested above, it is easy
to add a server for static content to a client, turning it into a
little bit of a two-way street.  The challenge is to make it nearly as
easy to serve dynamic content.</p>

<p>The technologies already available to us--XML, HTML, DOM, and
ECMAScript--are more than powerful enough to implement much of the
desired dynamic functionality.  We need to provide a few hooks to
access the browser's internals (like M2) and environment (like the
file system), but this is not hard and can certainly be handled in a
safe manner.  Thus dynamic functionality is within reach.</p>

<p>And this dynamic functionality has nontraditional applications: it
can be used to implement services that filter or aggregate information
from yet other services, and present them in ways more desirable to
new clients.  Thus it is becoming clear that clients and servers are
merging to some extent, and that "web browser" and "web server" are
names for functionality, not for programs.  The program might be
called a "web agent", though that name is certainly used for other
things as well.</p>


<h2>Opera users have interesting information</h2>

<p>A related point is that a typical instance of Opera contains useful
information: organized sets of bookmarks, notes pertaining to web
pages, and personal information like contact lists.  We could even see
an expanded version of Opera containing PIM-type information like
appointment calendars.  To some extent it is desirable to
<em>publish</em> this information, and what better tools than HTTP and
XML for making it available?  A web server in Opera should--at the
user's request--serve a subset of the information that Opera has
stored.</p>

<p>If Opera is storing information, exporting it, and used for reading
it, it should also be able to import it.  Implementing that would be
nearly trivial, and would provide a simple synchronization facility,
perhaps.</p>
