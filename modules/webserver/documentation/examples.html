<h1>Example applications of the two-way web</h1>


<p>This is a grab bag of ideas I have had myself or that have been
suggested by others.  Most things here are eminently doable; whether
all are desirable or anything but "nifty" is another matter.  Further
ideas are most welcome.  It seems that everyone I talk to adds one
more idea or twist to the set already here; this convinces me that
there is some utility in this.</p>

<p>No doubt there are technical issues that will become visible when
demos of these features are implemented.</p>


<h2>Obvious / straightforward</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Chat and other group communication applications

<dd><p>A lightweight chat server supporting a single chat room and not
    many bells and whistles can be written in less than 50 lines of
    JavaScript and a little HTML.  I know this, because I have written
    one.  The client is about twice as big, but still written only in
    JavaScript and HTML, and uses no Opera-specific features.</p>

    <p>The client sends requests--signifying message posts or queries
    for new messages--to the server in the form of normal HTTP
    requests.  The requests cause the invocation of script functions
    in a page loaded on the web server (ie, inside Opera).  The
    scripts compute their answers and return them as XML, which is
    then parsed by the client and displayed.</p>

<dt>Interactive multi-player games

<dd><p>Users who are not co-located but who wish to play games
    together can use programs written in JavaScript/DOM and
    communicating by HTTP to do so.  Simple examples are board games
    like Backgammon and Othello.  Most games that do not require rapid
    real-time response should be straightforward (especially in
    combination with OGP).</p>

<dt>Sharing of information in a group of Opera instances

<dd><p>Opera users may wish to publish some of the information
    available in their Opera instances.  The obvious example is
    bookmarks: say a user marks a bookmark as public.  Then anyone
    accessing the bookmarks service on that user's computer will see
    the bookmark.</p>

    <p>A bookmarks service is easily implemented; I have done so.
    Bookmarks are exported as XML.  Bookmark aggregation services
    could perhaps be built on top of this (and gives us a basic
    recommender system), but another application is for the user to be
    able to access her bookmarks while at another computer.</p>

    <p>In a similar way, it may be desirable to export some contacts
    or notes, and if Opera were to have a calendar/appointments
    function, to export appointments and use an information aggregator
    (see below) to create a calendar for a group.</p>

<dt>Lightweight dynamic queries, for small groups

<dd><p>I believe many users have occasional simple needs for a web
    server that can interact with its environment in trivial ways.
    For example, one may wish to run a simple web site for a small
    organization, accepting form mail from the site for queries and
    membership registrations.</p>

    <p>It is easy to support this in Opera.  There are two ways.  One
    could support traditional CGI scripts.  Or one could allow the
    scripting language to interact with its environment in controlled
    ways.  For example, the way Opera's web server works now, a script
    receives the data passed by a form submission as a string.  The
    script ought to be able to use M2 to send these data on to a third
    party, or to save it as a mail message in M2's inbox.</p>

    <p>It is also unproblematic for server-side scripts in Opera to
    access databases or the file system, in most cases, and these
    facilities should exist.</p>

    <p>(I think we should support CGI also, because one should never
    throw away working, reusable code, and there are many scripts out
    there.)</p>

<dt>Remote control of Opera

<dd><p>Since a web server is first of all a server responding to
    commands, it can be made to invoke internal functionality, thus
    one can control Opera from afar.</p>

    <p>There are probably limited uses for this, but one I have come
    up with is remote control of Opera during an OperaShow
    presentation.  Opera on a laptop is connected to the Internet and
    is running the presentation; the webserver is active.  The
    presenter is standing elsewhere in the room with her phone running
    Opera (or another browser, really).  When she wishes to move to
    the next slide, she can press a button on the web interface on
    her phone; this submits a request to the other Opera, which will
    page down as it would normally do and show the next slide.</p>

<dt>Information aggregation, filtering, abstraction, and re-presentation

<dd><p>Some information sources become more valuable if their data can
    be presented in a "richer" format.  For example, a person who reads
    many blogs may find it easier to aggregate these into a single web
    page and read that than to switch between many pages.  The same is
    probably true for RSS feeds, and for news services generally.</p>

    <p>A web browser can fairly easily implement a meta-search
    facility that submits a query to multiple engines and then creates
    a summary of the result.  (Actually it cannot, because of the
    too-restrictive JavaScript security model, but that is fixable.)
    A web server can then provide access to these summarized results.</p>

    <p>Data that are expensive to gather (either computationally or
    because a lot of data must be transferred for presentation
    purposes) can similarly be abstracted on a server and re-presented
    in a format more fitting for small devices--for example, NSB has a
    site with information about train delays that is slow and
    transfers quite a bit of data.  An Opera server can access this
    site every few minutes; a client on a phone can access the Opera
    server and be served a summary.</p>

    <p>The key point is that every Opera user can create her own
    summaries and serve them in a convenient form.</P>

<dt>Personal information manager

<dd><p>If Opera is becoming something more like a personal information
    manager every day, then Opera instances should be able to exchange
    and synchronize information.  This is easily done if one of the
    Opera instances has an HTTP server: it can both serve the current
    state of the system and accept updates.</p>

</dl>


<h2>Speculative / advanced</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Programmable proxy

<dd><p>Right now it is a little unclear what advantage we could derive
    from having a proxy.  Some ideas include ad filtering,
    anonymization, load balancing, and group-speaks-with-one-voice
    services.  But it should be clear that if we do have a proxy, it
    needs to be programmable just like other services are: any request
    can be served from a file, or from a script, or by an external
    program.</p>

    <p>A novel application for a network of proxies is beating the
    automatic Slashdot ban on too-frequently updating RSS readers.  :-P</p>

<dt>Peer-to-peer file sharing

<dd><p>A peer-to-peer file system consists of three mechanisms: for
    indexing, for download, and for upload.  The index maps query
    terms to URLs where files (or fragments thereof) may be found.
    The index must typically be distributed and replicated, and index
    searches are forwarded through the network in various manners.</p>

    <p>Once a location for an indexed item has been found, HTTP can be
    used to download the file.</p>

    <p>Files are also replicated, either eagerly or lazily.  In eager
    replication one needs to upload files.  An upload is just a
    download that sends a URL to the target agent and asks it to
    download it.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that by adding very simple functionality to
    Opera and to the environment component of the scripting system,
    one can implement practical file sharing entirely with JavaScript,
    XML, and Opera.</p>

<dt>Distributed computation (a la SETI@home)

<dd><p>Some distributed computation is very easily implemented.  One
    computer at a known name acts as a coordinator.  Other computers
    connect to it to make themselves available in the work pool (this
    is just a GET to a server on the coordinator).  When there is work
    to be done, the coordinator contacts a worker (using a GET on the
    worker's web server), passing it a URL that names the work to be
    done (a simple HTML page).  The worker loads this page, runs it
    locally (in the security domain of the coordinator, so there is no
    security issue), and when the computation is done the page submits
    the result to the coordinator with another GET.</p>

    <p>See the mandelbrot program in the examples directory for a
    simple application of this.</p>

    <p>(It is an issue that JavaScript is not quite as speedy as C or
    Java, but we should see that as a challenge to be taken on, not as
    an impediment.)</p>

    <p><em>Linda</em> is a technology for simple distributed and
    parallel computatation, proposed by David Gelernter [1].  The idea is
    that there is a "tuple space" that contains tuples of data, these
    are data to be worked on and the results of computations.  Agents
    interact with the tuple space by reading and writing tuples, some
    agents are pure workers and others are coordinators.  A tuple
    space should be easily implementable with our web server
    technology; phrasing the above example in terms of a tuple space,
    work to be done are simple URLs and work accomplished are pairs
    consisting of the URL and the result of the computation.</p>

<dt>Web-Mail service

<dd><p>Suppose you have a home office with several computers that you
    use.  (I do.)  If you are like me, you will end up downloading
    your mail onto multiple computers, because it is desirable to be
    able to read mail everywhere.  This is not ideal.  We can do
    better.</p>

    <p>A mail message in Opera is just an XML structure.  It would be
    simple for a web server to get a mail message from M2's mailbox
    and reformat it as HTML, thus creating a simple web-mail
    client.</p>
