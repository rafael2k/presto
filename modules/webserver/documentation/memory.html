<h1>Web server: Dynamic memory use and OOM handling</h1>

<dl>
<dt>OOM policies

<dd><p>If OOM occurs during server start, then the server is not
    started.  An error code is propagated from WebServer::Start() to
    indicate this condition, the caller must handle it further.</p>

    <p>If OOM occurs while a request is being served, then that
    service is aborted, the connection is closed, and any memory used
    to service the request is freed.  The condition is propagated to
    a central point within the webserver (WebServerImpl::SignalOOM),
    but the default action there is to drop the condition on the floor.</p>
   
<dt>Who handles OOM?
<dd><p>The module, for the most part.  See above.</p>

<dt>Flow
<dd><p>The server is started and stopped from elsewhere in Opera
    through WebServer::Start() and WebServer::Stop(). 
    
    All external api calls must only go to classes defined  in the
    webserver directory. All calls to functions defined in webserver/src/ 
    are prohibited.
    
    We also have entries points through the OpStocket callbacks and messageObject 
    callbacks in ControlChannel, WebserverRendezvous, WebServerConnectionListener 
    and WebServerConnection objects. 

<dt>Heap memory usage
<dd><p>Heap memory is allocated to store incoming data and as data buffers for data
    in transit.  These buffers live as long as the request does and are then
    immediately freed.</p>

<dt>Static memory usage
<dd><p> Currently there are three global pointers defined in webserver_module.h  </p>
<dt>Caching and freeing memory
<dd><p>The module at present does no caching by itself.</p>

<dt>Freeing memory on exit
<dd><p>All memory is freed when the webserver is stopped.  Terminate should stop the
    server by calling WebServer::Stop().</p>

<dt>Memory tuning
<dd><p>There are several tweaks to tweak buffer sizes. Take a look at module.tweaks for more information</p></dd>
