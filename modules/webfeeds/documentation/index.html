<h1>Webfeeds</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The Webfeeds module provides what is needed for parsing, storing and
displaying RSS and Atom feeds.

The external API of the WebFeeds module goes through the WebFeedsAPI
class. 
</p>

<h3>Formats supported</h3>
<p>
The module currently parses the following formats:
<ul>
  <li>RSS version 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94, 1.0 and 2.0
  <li>Atom version 0.3 and 1.0
</ul>

<h2>APIs</h2>
</p>

<p>
The external API of the WebFeeds module goes through the <a
href="api/classWebFeedsAPI.html">WebFeedsAPI</a>
class.
</p>

<p><a href="api/index.html">Generated API documentation</a>, if you've run
Doxygen on this module.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
This module requires FEATURE_WEBFEEDS_BACKEND to be defined.
</p>
<p>
The module is also able to create XML/HTML-data ready for display if
FEATURE_WEBFEEDS_DISPLAY is enabled.
</p>

<h2>Memory policy</h2>

<h3>Error Policy</h3>
<p>
All methods in the external API which can cause an error will return
an OP_STATUS which should 
be checked for ERR_NO_MEMORY and ERR. A few internal methods use
TRAP/LEAVE, but this should be invisible to the external API.
</p>

<p>
The callback method OnFeedLoaded will return a status of STATUS_OOM if
it encountered a OOM condition during loading.
</p>

<p>
The module will handle the error itself if it is able to, but in most
cases it isn't and will the return the error in an OP_STATUS, and the
caller will have to handle the error.
</p>

<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>
<p>
When parsing a feed (which will also happen when loading it) a WebFeed
object will be created for the feed, and a WebFeedEntry object for each
entry in the feed. These will contain most of the text of the feed
plus some status information. So memory use will be roughly
proportional to the size of the XML-data it parses.
</p>
<p>
The module will keep some feeds in memory also after they are parsed.
If disk storage of feeds is enabeled then the number is controlled by
TWEAK_WEBFEEDS_MAX_FEEDS_IN_MEMORY.  Although more may be kept in
memory if their reference count says someone outside the module is
using it.
Without disk storage all parsed feeds will
remain in memory. That could certainly see some improvement.
</p>
<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>
<p>
Stack memory use should be low, as the module does no recursive
calls, and allocates no big structures on the stack. But the
XML-parser might, see <a href="#other_modules">below</a>.
</p>
<h3>Temporary buffers</h3>
<p>
The module does not use the tempbuffers from the memory manager.
</p>
<h3>Memory tuning</h3>
<p>
The number of feeds cached in memory can be somewhat controlled by
TWEAK_WEBFEEDS_MAX_FEEDS_IN_MEMORY.  But the number of feeds kept may
be higher if external users of the module have references to feeds.
</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
There are no specific memory tests for this module.
</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>
In general just loading a feed should use most of the code in the module.
</p>

<h3 id="other_modules">Memory use in other modules</h3>
<p>
During parsing it uses the XML-parser (the internal in core-2, expat
in core-1). Check the documentation for the XML-parser to find out how
much memory that uses.
</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>

The parser code is based on the RSS module from M2.
