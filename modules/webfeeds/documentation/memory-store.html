  <h1>Webfeeds memory storage and memory use policy</h1>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>
  The module must be usable on devices with limited memory and disk
  space. Disk space policy is discussed elsewhere, this document
  discusses memory use.
  </p>
  <p>
  The module will be optimised for typical use. We assume that by
  typical use, a subscriber will subscribe to less than 1000 feeds,
  and that each feed typically contains less than 200 entries.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is also optimized for the typical use of reading a feed and its
  entries one at a time before moving on to the next feed and reading
  its entries. But not often going back and reread a feed where there
  are no new entries.
  </p>
  <p>
  Although this is the typical use the module is optimized for it
  should still work with other use patterns, but will not be as fast.
  </p>

  <h2>How many feeds to keep in memory</h2>
  <p>
  Feeds and its entries are always kept and deleted simultaniously in
  memory.
  </p>
  <h3>During loading/parsing</h3>
  <p>
  Feeds are constructed in memory when parsing, so all feeds currently
  being parsed have to be kept in memory. It should be possible to
  load several feeds simultaniously. The number of feeds being loaded
  simultaniously should be tweakable. For deviced with limlited
  bandwidth and memory two or three simultaniously loads could be
  enough, for a desktop much more feeds may be loaded simultaniously.
  </p>
  <h3>Externally referenced feeds/entries</h3>
  <p>
  Other modules (including javascript) may keep pointers to feeds and
  entries. The feeds should be kept in memory as long as other modules
  keep references to them.
  </p>
  <h3>Internal cache of feeds/entries</h3>
  <p>
  After one feed has been parsed, and particulary after its entry list
  has been displayed, its entries are very likely to be needed shortly
  (user want to read entries from the feed). It should therefore be
  kept in memory for some time after being parsed.
  When updating all feeds it's much harder to know which feed is
  needed next.
  </p>
  <p>
  One possible solution would be to always keep a limited number of
  feeds in memory after being parsed, and particulary after being
  displayed. A low number probably should suffice, particulary on
  devices with limited memory. Possibly as low as just one. Should be
  a tweakable number.
  </p>
  <h3>Retrieving feeds not in memory</h3>
  <p>
  If a feed is not in memory when it is requested/needed it must be
  retrieved from disk before it can be used. From the data storage
  format we've chosen we keep one file for each feed. Since feeds are
  predicted to remain fairly small reading the whole feed from disk
  and creating a feed (and entry) object from it should be fast enough
  to do synchronously. As a result it should be totally transparent
  from the outside if the entry is in memory or has to be fetched from
  disk storage.
  </p>

  <h2>Internal memory format</h2>
  <p>
  In addition to classes for feeds and entries there must be a general
  store class. This should record which feeds we are subscribed to,
  store all feeds which are in memory and be able to fetch feeds not
  in memory.
  </p>
  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <p>
  The store must be able to fetch feeds from their internal id if they
  are either in memory or in disk storage. Since it would be fairly
  common operation to fetch a feed by id it should be reasonably fast
  for a list of up to 1000 feeds.
  </p>
  <p>
  It should be able to generate a list of subscribed feeds, sorted in
  some logical way (alphabetically by feed title?). Expected to be
  done regulary, but not very often.
  </p>
  <p>
  Should be able to subscribe to new feeds and stop subscribing to
  existing feeds. Should be needed rarely and need not be
  particularly fast.
  </p>
  <h3>Possible data structures</h3>
  <h4>List</h4>
  <p>
  The easiest model would be a list of feeds. This would however
  require a linear search each time a feed is requested. Lists are
  fast at insertion and deletion which is expected to be a rare
  occurance. If sorted in same order as displayed it will be very fast
  to display sorted list. Probably only useful if totally number of
  feeds is low enough for the linear search not to be a factor.
  </p>
  <h4>Sorted array</h4>
  <p>
  An array sorted by id should be fast to look up feeds in (if doing
  binary search). It will however need to be sorted in a separate
  array  before display, and insertions and deletions will be fairly slow.
  </p>
  <h4>Hash</h4>
  <p>
  A hash will be very fast at looking up by id, and fast at insertions
  and deletions. As with arrays it will have to be sorted in a
  separate array before display. It also has the most general
  overhead, so there has to be quite a few feeds for its benefits to
  show.
  </p>
  <h4>Multiple datastructures</h4>
  <p>
  It's possible to use several in combination, e.g. a hash for fast
  lookup and an array for fast display. Both will then have to be
  updated simultaniously and both will have to be kept in memory. The
  overhead is probably not worth it except for on deviced with
  excessive memory.
