<h1>HTML Element References</h1>
<p>
HTML Elements may live a turbulent life, where they are created, inserted into trees, moved and 
deleted at various points.  And since references to HTML elements are often needed, it can be a pain to
always keep up with all that happens to the HTML_Element object.  So to ease some of that pain ElementRef
has been created.  It will be notified every time the HTML_Element is removed from a tree, inserted into a
tree, or deleted.
</p>

<h2>HTML_Element ownership</h2>
<p>The basic ownership model of an HTML_Element is that it is owned by the tree it is part of.  If it
is removed from a tree it will be owned by whoever removed the element, and when it is created and before
it has been inserted into a tree it is owned by the creator.  The special KeepAliveElementRef changes this
a little, in that when the original owner of the element tries to delete it, KeepAliveElementRef(s) will
take over the ownership and own it until the last KeepAliveElementRef no longer references it (in which case
the element is deleted) or until it is inserted into a tree again.</p>

<h2>How to use Element References</h2>
<p>There are principally two basic ElementRefs you can use.  AutoNullElementRef which sets the pointer to
NULL when the Element is deleted, and KeepAliveElementRef which prevents the Element from being deleted as long
as at least one KeepAliveElementRef has a pointer to it.  Additionally these classes may be overriden if you want
to do something more specific when something happens to the element.</p>

<h3>AutoNullElementRef</h3>
<p>This reference is very basic.  It will just set the reference to NULL if the Element is deleted. The user
will then obviously have to check it for NULL before using it, if there is any chance the element may have been
 deleted since it was last checked.</p>

<h3>KeepAliveElementRef</h3>
<p>KeepAliveElementRef is for those cases when you require the element to stay alive.  The reference will
prevent the element from being deleted as long as the reference exists. However, do note that in the cases
where the element would have been deleted, it will now just exist in a sort of limbo.  It will have been removed
from the tree, and is unreachable except through the KeepAliveElementRef(s) still holding a reference to it.
The reference only keeps the single element it references alive, not any other part of the tree it was part of
(unlike elements which DOM have a reference to, which keep entire sub trees alive).
</p>
<p>
If someone ("the real owner") has tried to delete the element, it will be deleted as soon as the
last KeepAliveElementRef which had a reference to it stops referencing it.
</p>
<p>
If an element which is only referenced by one or more KeepAliveElementRef is inserted into a tree again, then
the KeepAliveElementRef(s) will relinquish ownership to the tree, and not try to delete the element. 
</p>

<h3>Subclassing ElementRef</h3>
<p>If the existing sub classes of ElementRef doesn't do what you need, you can make your own.  If you intend to
keep the element alive when someone tries to delete it, then you MUST subclass KeepAliveElementRef (it can of course 
be indirect inheritance).</p>
<p>Subclasses of ElementRef can implement OnDelete() which will be called when someone tries to delete the element,
OnRemoved() which is called when someone removes the element from the tree and OnInsert() when the element
is inserted into a tree.</p>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>
<p>This section is mostly for internal logdoc use to help explain and debug ElementRef issues.</p>

<h3>What is an ElementRef?</h3>
<p>It's a pointer to an HTML_Element, plus previous and next pointers to other ElementRefs.  The HTML_Element has
a list of all ElementRefs that point to it (through a pointer to the first ElementRef), which it uses to notify
the ElementRefs whenever the element is removed, deleted etc.</p>

<h3>Where does the notifications happen?</h3>
<p>Both OnRemove() and OnDelete() are called from HTML_Element::Clean().  Which one is called is decided by
the going_to_delete parameter.  Everyone who intends to delete an HTML_Element should call Clean() before
calling Free() (and only call Free() if Clean returns TRUE).  A call to Clean(), even with a TRUE going_to_delete
parameter doesn't mean the element will be deleted now, only that the previous owner of the element doesn't need
it anymore.</p>
<p>OnInsert() is called from HTML_Element::ElementSignalInserted() and HTML_Element::DOMMoveToOtherDocument().</p>

<h3>How KeepAliveElementRefs work and their ownership model</h3>
<p>Until the original owner of an HTML_Element does Clean() a KeepAliveElementRef works just like other
ElementRefs.  When Clean() is called (with going_to_delete = TRUE) all KeepAliveElementRefs which have a reference
to the element will set their m_free_element_on_delete flag to TRUE.  When (if) the original owner calls
Free(), the element will be prevented from actually being deleted as long as there is at least one
KeepAliveElementRef which references it (by checking if the elements list of ElementsRefs is non-empty).</p>

<p>If the element is inserted into a tree again, it is assumed the new tree takes over ownership of the element
and the m_free_element_on_delete flag is reset to FALSE.</p>

<p>Every time a KeepAliveElementRef stops referencing an element (by being deleted, or set to reference something
else or NULL), and if its m_free_element_on_delete flag is set, it will try to delete the element by doing a regular
call to Clean() before possibly calling Free().  If DOM still holds a reference to the element, then Clean
will return FALSE, and the KeepAliveElementRef which lost the reference will not Free() it - DOM owns it. If Clean()
returns TRUE then only KeepAliveElementRefs should have a reference to it.  If any other KeepAliveElementRefs
still do, the element will again be prevented from being deleted in Free(), and the other KeepAliveElementRefs 
now collectively owns the element.  Once the last KeepAliveElementRef stops referencing the element it will 
actually be deleted in Free()... Unless DOM has gained a reference, or it has been inserted into the tree again,
in which case the tree or DOM respectively still owns the element.</p>
