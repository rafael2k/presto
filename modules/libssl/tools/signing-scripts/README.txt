DO NOT use the key in verify_key.priv for anything serious, it is intended for 
selftests.

The password for verify_key.priv is "test"

==== Usage of scripts ====

The scripts, written as shellscripts, but they should be easy to convert to bat-
files, must be run on a computer that supports OpenSSL and Perl.

These files must be copied to the target machine:

   creatersakey.sh
   signfile.sh
   createinc.pl
   createsig.pl

Common datafiles: These files are generated by creatersakey.sh

   verify_key.priv  : Private key encrypted with password
   verify_key.pub   : Public key (DER encoded)
   verify_key.h     : H-file with char array of verify_key.pub, MUST be copied into source
   verify_key.b64   : PEM version of verify_key.pub


* creatersakey.sh

This command creates a new 2048 bit RSA private key and encrypts it using a 
password you have to enter, it will then output the public key as DER and PEM 
files (You must enter the password for this part) and create a C headerfile 
containing the public key. This headerfile must be inserted into the sourcecode 
that will load the signed files and the contained buffer must be sent as an argument to
VerifySignedTextFile.

* signfile.sh

  This script is optimised for Javascript files

  Command line: signfile.sh inputfile outputfile
  
This command will create a signature for inputfile using the key in 
verify_key.priv (you must enter the password), and creates an outputfile 
starting with a "// " followed by the base64 encoded signture on the first line
The content from the inputfile is then appended.

A selftest signature check is done by the script.
