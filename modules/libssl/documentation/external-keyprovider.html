<h1>External Client Certificate and Key Providers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This API provides the ability of products to configure SSL/TLS Client Authentication certificates and the associated Private Key
for a given site, or based on the server's list of desired certificate issuer's.</p>

<p>Currently the API is not able to support password protected Private Keys, only pre-enabled keys. The API will later be expanded to 
support Smartcards, including those protected by login or PIN-codes.
</p>

<p>Historical note: This functionality was previously designed primarily as a Smartcard provider, but have been renamed and refurbished 
to provide more general functionality. At the time of writing some of that code is still present, but disabled using #ifdefs, as it
has not been updated to new functionality.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The libssl module object contain the member LibSSL::m_external_clientkey_manager, which is a list of all registred providers. 
When a SSL/TLS server requests a Client Certificate each provider in this list is asked to provide certificates and keys that are suitable for the server, 
based on its name and/or the list of authorities the server specified in its request.</p>

<p>The providers are based on the class SSL_KeyManager, defined in "modules/libssl/smartcard/smc_man.h", and this class provides the APIs necessary for 
the operation of the implementation's provider.</p>

<h3>SSL_KeyManager</h3>	

<dl>
<dt>GetAvailableKeys
	<dd><p>Asks the provider to select and add the most suitable certificate and key pairs it have available for the
		named server and/or the requested certificate issuers. Note that a provider does not need to check either of these, 
		though it is recommended. The implementation should create a certificate list, and configure a SSL_PublicKeyCipher derived object (can be requested from 
		g_ssl_api->CreatePublicKeyCipher()) to use a RSA private key (actual loading is done using the PublicKeyCipher::LoadAllKeys() API), then call the function 
		SSL_KeyManager::SetupCertificateEntry to add the certificate.</p>
		
		<p>It is possible for the implementation to configure the SSL_PublicKeyCipher object to be used automatically, using the SSL_PublicKeyCipher::Set_UseAutomatically API.
		NOTE: This option should be used cautiosly, since it disables the UI query to the user, and may reveal sensitive privacy-related information about the user. 
		It should only be used against specific sites, not general sites.</p>
		
<dt>SetupCertificateEntry
	<dd><p>Utility function that creates a key and certificate item and adds it to the list of such items. The function takes a certificate varvector list, a fully configured public key, 
		and name information as arguments, then creates the item. The item takes ownership of the public key object.</p>
<dt>AllowedCertificate
	<dd><p>Utility function that allows the implementation to check if a issuer name (as a varvector) is in the list of issuer names provided by the server.</p>
<dt>Register
	<dd> <p>Registers the provider in the module's list of providers.</p>
<dt>Unregister
	<dd><p>Removes the provider from the module's list of providers. This is automatic when the object is destroyed.</p>
