<h1>Module: IDNA</h1>

<h2>About this module</h2>

The IDNA module performs encoding and decoding of Punycoded servernames according to the IETF IDNA standards.

This module contains the Unicode parts of the URL_Manager class.

<p>Supported specifications:<p>
<UL>
<li> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt">IDNA 1</a> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3454.txt">2</a>  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3491.txt">3</a> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3492.txt">4</a>
</UL>

<h3>An overview of the module's implementation</h3>

<p> The module implements the GetServerName parts of URL_Manager and preprocesses each label in the servername by first validating the characters by testing against character conversion lists and blacklists, then converting it to punycode, if necessary, before finally recombining it with the rest of the name. The module also controls the revers process.</p>

<h2>Interface overview and API documentation</h2>

<p><a href="api/index.html">API documentation generated by
Doxygen</a> contains all necessary information for the external APIs.</p>

<h3>Footprint</h3>

<p>The module is small.</p>

<h3>Dynamic memory use and OOM handling</h3>

<dl>
<dt>OOM policies
<dd><p>Most of internal module functions handles OOM by LEAVing, and the caller must TRAP errors and handle them. </p>

<dt>Who handles OOM?
<dd><p>In the case of LEAVE functions the caller must TRAP the errors, and handle the OOM situations.</p>

<dt>Flow
<dd><p>The module is client push based, the caller request an action and gets a result.</p>

<dt>Heap memory usage <dd> <p>Most of the operations are performed in the fixed 
buffers stored in the module object, but the URL_Manager parts do allocate 
through the URL module's ServerName manager code</p>

<dt>Stack memory usage
<dd><p>Usually large objects are allocated </p>

<p>In most cases stack consumption should be less than 300 bytes.</p>

<dt>Static memory usage
<dd><p>The module uses 3 buffers of 256 unicode characters in the module object</p>
<p>There are also some const arrays used for processing characters. These may total a few thousand 32-bit 
unichars and associated integer flags. Most have been collected in a single array for processing efficiency and are coded for ranges to reduce footprint.</p>

<p>Additionally the module uses the temporary buffers of the URL_Manager (some functions are implemented in this moduele) and my increase these to more than 5 times the input servername, in order to handle large punycoded servernames.</p>

<dt>Caching and freeing memory
<dd><p>No caching is performed. All long term storage is inside ServerName objects</p>

<dt>Freeing memory on exit
<dd><p>Temp buffers are destroyed on exit.</p>

<dt>Temp buffers
<dd><p>No shared tempbuffers are used.</p>

<dt>Memory tuning
<dd><p>At present there are no opportunities to tune memory use.</p>

<dt>Tests
<dd><p>Selftests, but they do not check memory usage.</p>

<dt>Coverage
<dd><p>Selftests, ordinary surfing to sites using international characters in their hostnames or domains.</p>

<dt>Design choices
<dd><p>The code processes one label at a time</p>


<dt>Improvements
<dd><p>No improvements are planned related to memeory</p>
