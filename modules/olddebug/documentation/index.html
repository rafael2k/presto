  <h1>Olddebug module documentation</h1>

  <p>The 'olddebug' module is used for debugging parts of the URL
  module.  Module owner is unaware of any other uses for this module.</p>

  <p>If you are using functionality in the 'olddebug' module for
  anything else than debugging URL, please let the module-owner know
  as the plan for 'olddebug' is to provide the functionality required
  through debug, probetools and scope.</p>

  <p>Knowing what this module is used for will help in this transition.</p>

  <h2>Known problems</h2>
  <p>The global Opera object is not always created when it should.  This
  is decided to be of little importance in the long run.  If you do have
  issues with this, please let it be known!</p>

  <h2>API</h2>
  <p>As this module is to be deprecated, you are not enchouraged to use
  it, and documentation for the API will not be provided.  You will have
  to learn the hard way, sorry...</p>
