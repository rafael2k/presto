 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  The <em>Bookmarks module</em> provides support for adding,
  modifying, removing and storing bookmarks.

 <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

 <p>
  A folder structure of bookmarks is represented by a tree structure
  of objects of type BookmarkItem. A BookmarkItem represents both
  bookmarks and folders of bookmarks. Information about each bookmark
  such as name, URL and description is stored in each BookmarkItem as
  BookmarkAttribute. To identify a bookmark each BookmarkItem also has
  a uid (unique identification).
 </p>

 <p>
  To add new bookmarks, change the folder structure, delete or move
  bookmarks etc. the class BookmarkManager is used.
 </p>

 <p>
  When loading and saving bookmarks the BookmarkManager class and an
  implementation of the BookmarkStorageProvider interface class is
  used.
 </p>

 <p>
  There are several functions available for setting different
  restrictions on the total number of bookmarks, the number of
  bookmarks in each folder and maximum folder depth. It is also
  possible to set restrictions on the length of the different
  attributes of a bookmark, for example maximum length of a name, URL
  or description. If an attribute restriction is violated the
  attribute can either be cut at the specified maximum length or an
  error may be returned.
 </p>

 <p>
  A minimal user interface is provided through <a
  href="opera:bookmarks">opera:bookmarks</a>.
 </p>

 <h2 id="usecases">Use-cases</h2>

 <h3 id="createmodifybookmark">Creating and modifying bookmarks</h3>
 <p>
  A new bookmark is added using AddBookmark or AddNewBookmark. The
  latter sets a timer which will cause the bookmarks to be saved to
  storage when the time is out. Modification of a bookmark is achieved
  using the function SetAttribute.
 </p>

 <h3 id="deletemovebookmark">Delete and move bookmarks</h3>
 <p>
  Bookmarks or folders of bookmarks may be deleted or moved. In case a
  trash folder has been added, deleting a bookmark will mean moving it
  to the trash folder. When a bookmark has been deleted a timer is set
  which will cause the bookmarks to be saved when time is out.
 </p>

 <h3 id="loadbookmarks">Loading bookmarks</h3>
 <p>
 To load bookmarks first create an BookmarkManager object and then an
 BookmarkStorageProvider object. Depending on which type of storage
 the bookmarks are stored on, different derived classes may be
 used. Currently only BookmarkIniStorage is supported. By writing a
 class that inherits BookmarkStorageProvider more formats and storage
 forms may be used. Using this class the bookmarks must be stored in
 an ini-file. Then to find out when all bookmarks are loaded a
 listener BookmarkManagerListener must be registered. OnBookmarksLoaded
 is called when all bookmarks are loaded.
 </p>
 <p>
 When using BookmarkIniStorage the method OpenLoad must be called
 before using it with LoadBookmarks. The parameters to this method are
 a filename and an OpFileFolder.
 </p>

 <h3 id="savebookmarks">Saving bookmarks</h3>
 <p>
 Saving bookmarks is done in almost the same way as loading
 bookmarks. A BookmarkStorageProvider is needed and also a
 BookmarkManager. To save all bookmarks to storage SaveBookmarks is
 called. When all bookmarks are saved the method OnBookmarksSaved is
 called on registered BookmarkManagerListener objects.
 </p>
 <p>
 When using BookmarkIniStorage some of the methods OpenSave or
 OpenLoad must have been called supplying the filename and folder
 where the ini-file is located.

 </p>

 <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/classBookmarkManager.html">BookmarkManager</a>
  class contains almost all functionality needed by a user of the
  bookmarks module. In order to support a large number of bookmarks
  and slow or unreliable storage forms, both saving and loading are
  asynchronous. Thus when BookmarkStorageProvider::SaveBookmark or
  BookmarkStorageProvider::LoadBookmark is called, BookmarkManager
  calls BookmarkStorageProvider::SaveBookmark or
  BookmarkStorageProvider::LoadBookmark and then saves its state and
  returns. The BookmarkStorageProvider may then for example connect to
  a host on the internet or just read or write to some file. When the
  BookmarkStorageProvider is done it calls
  BookmarkManager::BookmarkIsSaved or
  BookmarkManager::BookmarkIsLoaded. Then, in case no error occurred,
  the BookmarkManager sends a message to the main message
  handler. When this message is processed
  BookmarkManager::HandleCallback is called and SaveBookmarks or
  LoadBookmarks is called again. Now the previous state is loaded and
  if there are more bookmarks the loop continues. When all bookmarks
  are saved or loaded the function
  BookmarkManagerListener::OnBookmarksSaved or
  BookmarkManagerListener::OnBookmarksLoaded is called.
 </p>

 <p>
  The <a
  href="api/classBookmarkStorageProvider.html">BookmarkStorageProvider</a>
  class defines an interface to a storage form. In this way different
  storage forms may be implemented. The only storage form currently
  supported is BookmarkIniStorage which stores bookmarks in an
  INI-file using prefsfile.
 </p>

 <p>
  The <a href="api/classBookmarkItem.html">BookmarkItem</a> class
  holds all information associated to a particular bookmark. Every
  such information is an attribute which is defined in the <a
  href="api/classBookmarkAttribute.html">BookmarkAttribute</a>
  class. The supported attributes are defined in BookmarkAttributeType.
 </p>

 <p>
  A user interface is accessed by opera:bookmarks. This is generated
  by the class OperaBookmarks and the function
  OperaBookmarks::GenerateData. This function generates a HTML document
  containing javascript which calls functions for adding, deleting,
  moving, saving and loading bookmarks. These functions are defined in
  the class JS_Opera in the dom module. They use the functionality
  provided by the BookmarkManager.
 </p>

 <h3 id="memorymanagement">Memory management</h3>
 <h4 id="heapusage">Heap usage</h4>
 <p>
  Each bookmark contain a number of attributes and also a unique
  identifier. All of these are allocated on the heap. They are freed
  when the bookmark holding them is freed.
 </p>

 <p>
  
 </p>

 <h4 id="stackusage">Stack usage</h4>
 <p>
  There are no recursive calls.
 </p>

 <h4 id="staticmemoryusage">Static memory usage</h4>
 <p>
  There is one global pointer to the BookmarkManager object.
 </p>

 <h4 id="oompolicies"><abbr title="Out of memory">OOM</abbr> policies</h4>
 <p>
  All functions return OpStatus::ERR_NO_MEMORY to the caller when out of memory.
