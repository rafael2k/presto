		<h1>SVG Module Memory Documentation</h1>

		<h2>Used OOM policies</h2>
		<p>
			The general rule is that the svg module returns OP_STATUS
			codes. RaiseCondition is used in the textformating in SVGTextLayout and for failed allocations of svg image buffers in SVGImageImpl.
		</p>

		<h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>
		<p>
			The error if any is returned to the caller via the methods in
			SVGManager/SVGImage. The svg module does not handle OOM in
			any other way than returning the error.
		</p>

		<h2>Description of flow</h2>
		<p>
			The method called to render an SVG image is
			SVGImage::PaintOnScreen. An SVGImage is generally obtained
			through the SVGManager::GetSVGImage.
		</p>
		<p>
			The render call traverses the element tree and performs a
		   number of steps for each elements - most notably
		   enter/handle/leave. If there's a OOM error in any of these
		   steps the error is returned and the stack is restored.
		</p>

		<h2>Heap memory usage</h2>
		<p>
		   The canvas/svg surface buffers are allocated in heap memory
		   and accounts for the major part of memory usage, [width x
		   height x 4] bytes (since the buffers are always 32bpp). The
		   <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> values are not the calculated
		   width and height, but the width and height of the largest
		   paint received. In addition, one bitmap is allocated to use
		   for blitting the different canvas buffers to the
		   screen/visdev.
		</p>
		<p>
			SVG attributes are also allocated on the heap, and they vary
			in size. The paths generated for libvega may be large if the
			flatness factor (PrefsCollectionDisplay::SVGRenderingQuality)
			is set too low or if paths are very complex ( = many Beziér
			curves and/or arcs). The libvega paths are mostly temporary
			objects of short lifespan, but there are exceptions like
			motionpaths (used by animateMotion animations, and textPath).
		</p>
		<p>
			Elements have an associated context (generally an
			SVGElementStateContext), that is heap allocated and contains
			element-specific information, such as screen and bounding
			boxes.
		</p>
		<p>
			When performing rendering of filters, a number of surfaces
			are allocated to store intermediate results. The size (and
			thus the memory usage) of these surfaces are determined by
			the area in the document being filtered.
		</p>
		<p>
			During rendering of an svg document, buffers for intermediate
			results can be allocated (ex: group opacity and pattern
			handling). The memory consumed by such operations vary
			greatly depending of the size the area in question.
		</p>

		<h2>Stack memory usage</h2>
		<p>
			Document traversal and dependency graph keep state on the heap. There are no very recursive methods in the svg module.
			Stack memory requirements for the svg module should in general be quite low.
		</p>

		<h2>Static memory usage</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				A global SVGManager object (g_svg_manager)</li>
				<li>
				Various bison state machine jump tables</li>
				<li>
					String tables for SVG identifiers (attribute names, element names, some 
					attribute values)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Caching and freeing memory</h2>
		<p>
			A fixed number of images are cached since it may take some
			time to re-render an image, this will use [width x height x
			4] bytes per image (see <i>Heap memory usage</i> for
			definition of width/height). The caches can be cleared via
			methods in SVGManager, and are of course cleared when the
			SVGManager is destructed. Some other things that are cached:
			screen boxes (layouted size on screen), glyphs when drawing
			text.
		</p>
		<p>Methods available to empty caches:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				SVGImage::InvalidateAll (or SVGManager::InvalidateCaches)
				- for a specific SVG document fragment
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		  A call to the FreeCachedData() method in SvgModule
		  (OperaModule) will cause all allocated renderers to
		  be deleted.
		</p>

		<h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>
		<p>
			The SVGManager will return memory and clear all svg caches when 
			destructed. When a HTML_Element tree is destructed it also destructs its 
			attributes, and when a SVG root element is destructed it destructs caches 
			associated with itself.
		</p>

		<h2>Temp buffers</h2>

		<h3>Current use of MemoryManager temporary buffers</h3>
		<p>
			The SVGTextLayout class uses a tempbuffer
			(MemoryManager::GetTempBuf2k) to handle text transformations,
			it's used in the same way as the VisualDevice Txt*-methods
			use it and the code is structured in a similar fashion. There
			is a define SVG_TXTOUT_USE_TMPBUFFER that is currently on,
			that can be turned off to make svg allocate the memory on the
			heap instead.
		</p>

		<h3>Safety</h3>
		<p>
			The tempbuffer is used only when drawing the text, and the
			text drawing is only done via calls to the SVGTextLayout
			class (which is not an exported API).  It's guaranteed that
			the buffer is OK as long as the SVGManager-methods don't
			return while in the middle of drawing text.
		</p>

		<h2>Memory tuning</h2>
		<p>
			The svg features can be tuned to save some memory. The svg
			image cache should be rewritten to be tweakable by the
			module.tweaks-system.
		</p>

		<h2>Tests</h2>
		<p>
			None.
		</p>

		<h2>Coverage</h2>
		<p>
			Go through the w3c svg testsuite for example,
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Test/</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Design choices</h2>
		<p>
			The svg attributes are somewhat more complex than their HTML
			counterparts since they need to be animatable, meaning it
			requires some extra footprint. We cache screen boxes of
			elements so that interaction will be faster, and also for
			knowing what parts should be cleared when animating. The goal
			is to paint only changed areas, and as little as
			possible. The calculations for invalidating an element can be
			(relatively) expensive if the full area of an image changes
			all the time, but in general it should be cheaper to do these
			layout traversals since it's (relative to traversing the tree)
			expensive to draw the graphics. The formula is subject to
			change if hardware accelerated graphics support is added.
		</p>
		<h2>Suggestions of improvements</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shrinking the size of element contexts</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
