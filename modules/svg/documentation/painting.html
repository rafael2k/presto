<h1>The SVG painting process</h1>

<p>
Main classes involved (in a somewhat "chronological" order):
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SVGImage(Impl)</code></li>
<li><code>SVGManager(Impl)</code></li>
<li><code>SVGRenderer</code></li>
<li><code>SVGTraverser</code> / <code>SVG(Visual)TraversalObject</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Painting to screen</h2>

<h3>The journey begins</h3>

<p>
The paint is (regularly) initiated by a call to
<code>SVGImage::PaintToScreen</code> [PTS] (from
<code>SVGContent::Paint</code>). The <code>SVGImage</code> reference
has been acquired through a call to the global <code>SVGManager</code>
object. PTS does little besides dispatching the render operation
further down the line, and handling the actual painting of the result
on the visual device.
</p>

<p>
The paint call proceeds by:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Locating/creating renderstate (<code>SVGRenderer</code>) associated
with the element to paint</li>
<li>Detecting changes in size (visual device scale et.c.)</li>
<li>Update running animations</li>
<li>Run a layout pass</li>
<li>Update renderstate (the actual paint)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The above is the flow unless there is a rendering job currently
in-progress. In that case, the current paint area is queued, and will
be submitted after the current job has finished.
</p>

<h3>Painting traversal</h3>

<p>
The <code>SVGRenderer</code> class is tasked with keeping track of
what parts of the SVG that has an up-to-date state. This is achieved
through the use of a region data structure (<code>OpRegion</code>),
which represents the (total) area covered by a number of
rectangles. When updating renderstate (in
<code>SVGRenderer::Update</code>), the region is used together with
the area of interest, that was passed into the SVGRenderer through the
Setup-call, to determine what parts of the <code>SVGCanvas</code> that
needs to be updated. A scheme is used that results in 1 to 4
rectangular areas. Each one of these areas are updated through a call
to <code>SVGRenderer::UpdateSingleRect</code> [internal].
</p>

<p>
<code>SVGRenderer::UpdateSingleRect</code> sets up a
<code>SVGTraverser</code> in an appropriate manner for the rectangle
specified, and traverses the tree.
</p>

<h2>Painting to a buffer (intermediate)</h2>

<p>
The process described above mostly applies to the case where the
results end up on the visual device. There are however another case
worth mentioning - painting to an intermediate surface (currently used
for cases such as <i>CSS background-image / list-item</i>, <i>Save as
(PNG)</i> and <i>svgtest</i>).
</p>

<p>
The painting of an SVG to an intermediate buffer is achieved through a
call to the <code>SVGImage::PaintToBuffer</code>-method. This call
does things similar in nature to a PTS ->
<code>SVGRenderer::Update</code> chain, but makes sure that any
current renderstate is destroyed. It also has provisions for handling
the setting of specific dimensions and animation times.
