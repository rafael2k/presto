    <p>
SVG can read font-files by its own in order to display scalable fonts
when the platform can't provide any. This is controlled by the feature
FEATURE_SVG_EMBEDDED_FONTS and assumes that fonts are placed in the
folder pointed out by OPFILE_RESOURCES_FOLDER. The fonts are available
in modules/svg/script/fntextract/ and are named svg-*.dat.

Questions about which platforms that may want to use this feature can
be directed to anyone in the svg team, davve@opera.com, fs@opera.com
or ed@opera.com.
