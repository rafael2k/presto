		<h1>SVG support notes</h1>
		<h2>Coordinate range</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Note</b>: To configure Vega to use fixedpoint you need to edit 
			modules/libvega/vegaconfig.h and disable the define <code>VEGA_USE_FLOATS</code>. 
			The comments below only apply to the SVG module.
		</p>
		<h3>TWEAK_SVG_DOUBLE_PRECISION_ARITHMETICS = NO</h3>
		<p class="indent">
			This is the default. It means we use <code>float</code> precision for 
			calculations in the SVG module.
		</p>
		<h3>TWEAK_SVG_DOUBLE_PRECISION_ARITHMETICS = YES</h3>
		<p class="indent">
			This means that we use <code>double</code> precision for calculations in the 
			SVG module.
		</p>
		<h2>Events</h2>
		<p>
			There is support for listening to any event in the svg module. Some events are 
			not sent by core, for example: <code>activate</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			SVG 1.1 doesn't specify a key-event set, and thus the attributes <code>onkeyup</code>,
			<code>onkeydown</code> and <code>onkeypress</code> don't register a 
			corresponding event listener for those events. Note that the Adobe viewer 
			handles the onkey*-attributes. In Opera it's possible to install listeners for 
			key-events with DOM, for example: <code>element.addEventListener('keydown', 
				keyhandler-function, false)</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If key-events are used it's vital to use <code>evt.preventDefault()</code> to 
			prevent any key-event that should be handled only by the script from escaping 
			upwards to the UI which may be listening for shortcut keys. Note that Opera has 
			many single-key shortcuts.
		</p>
		<h2>Font selection</h2>
		<p>Specifying more than one font for fallback purposes is supported, but it should 
			be noted that the font will be chosen at the time it's needed, and the context 
			is lost soon after, which means that a fallback font may not be used if 
			unsupported glyphs are encountered. The list of fallback fonts will be gone 
			through and the first matching font will be chosen when entering a text 
			element. However, Opera will switch the font if it finds glyphs it can't render 
			with the current one, but in doing so it doesn't take into account the 
			specified fallback fonts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Example:
			<pre>&lt;text font-family="MySVGFont1, MySVGFont2"&gt;ABC&lt;/text&gt;</pre>
		MySVGFont1 only has the glyph 'A' and MySVGFont2 has the glyphs 'B' and 'C'. 
		The SVG engine picks MySVGFont1 and starts drawing text, then encounters 'BC' 
		and those are either drawn using the missing-glyph or by switching to another 
		font. If the font is switched then MySVGFont2 won't be the chosen one, but 
		rather a platform-defined suitable fallback.
		</p>
		<h2>Integration</h2>
		<p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Type of SVG inclusion</th>
					<th>Requirement(s)</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In <code>html:object</code> element</td>
					<td>FEATURE_SVG = YES</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In <code>html:iframe</code> element</td>
					<td>FEATURE_SVG = YES</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In <code>html:embed</code> element</td>
					<td>FEATURE_SVG_IN_EMBED_ELEMENT = YES</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In <code>html:img</code> element</td>
					<td>FEATURE_SVG_IN_IMG_ELEMENT = YES</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>In CSS <code>background-image</code> and <code>list-style-image</code></td>
					<td>FEATURE_SVG_IN_CSS_BACKGROUND = YES</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>
		<h2>Interoperability</h2>
		<p>
			Some content may fail to render if sent with the wrong mime-type, or if the 
			namespace declarations are missing. The correct mime-type for svg is <code>image/svg+xml</code>. 
			The namespaces to open are svg: <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code> and 
			xlink: <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For CSS it should be noted that you must specify length values with units. For 
			example:
			<br>
			<code>font-size: 12;</code> in CSS will mean the value is invalid, and thus it 
			will be ignored. This applies to all 'style' elements, 'style' attributes and external stylesheets.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Adobe getter/setter DOM extensions are not supported. Example: <code>evt.getTarget()</code>
			is <code>evt.target</code> in Opera.
		</p>
		<h2>Performance</h2>
		<p>We have based our implementation on our vector library Vega, which is the same 
			for all platforms. This means we get the same functionality on all platforms, 
			and that some performance bottlenecks are the same too. Things that are 
			relatively expensive to use, performance-wise:
			<ul>
				<li>filters</li>
				<li>transparency layers (group opacity)</li>
				<li>masks</li>
			</ul>
		This is not meant to discourage you to use the functionality, but rather to 
		make it known that your content may render in a way that may feel suboptimal if 
		viewed on a computer that is less powerful than your own. Animating filters is 
		possible, but computationally intensive for example.
		</p>
		<h2>Printing</h2>
		<p>
			SVG is output as a bitmap image to the printer. It's not sent in vector format, 
			which means that the resulting output is not as crisp as it could have been.
