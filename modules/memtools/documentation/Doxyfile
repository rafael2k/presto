# Doxyfile 1.4.5

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for the lea_malloc module at Opera.
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")
#
# Options which coincide with defaults from doxygen -g - are here elided.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME		= "memtools"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER		= amnesia_1

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY	= .

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES		= NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc
# comments will behave just like the Qt-style comments (thus requiring an
# explicit @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF	= YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available.
# Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless
# the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES

EXTRACT_ALL		= YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated
# by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank NO is used.

QUIET			= NO

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank
# NO is used.

WARNINGS		= YES

# If WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED is set to YES, then doxygen will generate warnings
# for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag will
# automatically be disabled.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED	= YES

# If WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR is set to YES, doxygen will generate warnings for
# potential errors in the documentation, such as not documenting some
# parameters in a documented function, or documenting parameters that
# don't exist or using markup commands wrongly.

WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR	= YES

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be abled to get warnings for
# functions that are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters
# or return value. If set to NO (the default) doxygen will only warn about
# wrong or incomplete parameter documentation, but not about the absence of
# documentation.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC	= NO

# The WARN_FORMAT tag determines the format of the warning messages that
# doxygen can produce. The string should contain the $file, $line, and $text
# tags, which will be replaced by the file and line number from which the
# warning originated and the warning text. Optionally the format may contain
# $version, which will be replaced by the version of the file (if it could
# be obtained via FILE_VERSION_FILTER)

WARN_FORMAT		= "$file:$line: $text"

# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning
# and error messages should be written. If left blank the output is written
# to stderr.

WARN_LOGFILE		=

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT			= ..

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx
# *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.py

FILE_PATTERNS		= *.h

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will
# be generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure also
# VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER		= YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ALPHABETICAL_INDEX tag is set to YES, an alphabetical index
# of all compounds will be generated. Enable this if the project
# contains a lot of classes, structs, unions or interfaces.

ALPHABETICAL_INDEX	= YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate HTML output.

GENERATE_HTML		= YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT		= api

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX		= NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# evaluate all C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include
# files.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING	= YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES Doxygen will expand all macro
# names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional
# compilation will be performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled
# way by setting EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION		= YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES
# then the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the
# PREDEFINED and EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF	= YES

# If the SEARCH_INCLUDES tag is set to YES (the default) the includes files
# in the INCLUDE_PATH (see below) will be search if a #include is found.

SEARCH_INCLUDES		= YES

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by
# the preprocessor.

INCLUDE_PATH		=

# You can use the INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard
# patterns (like *.h and *.hpp) to filter out the header-files in the
# directories. If left blank, the patterns specified with FILE_PATTERNS will
# be used.

INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS	=

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED		= DOXYGEN_DOCUMENTATION __cplusplus \
                          HAVE_LTH_MALLOC PARTIAL_LTH_MALLOC \

			  ADDR2LINE_SUPPORT STACK_TRACE_SUPPORT \
			  MEMTEST

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then
# this tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded.
# The macro definition that is found in the sources will be used.
# Use the PREDEFINED tag if you want to use a different macro definition.

EXPAND_AS_DEFINED	=

# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES (the default) then
# doxygen's preprocessor will remove all function-like macros that are alone
# on a line, have an all uppercase name, and do not end with a semicolon. Such
# function macros are typically used for boiler-plate code, and will confuse
# the parser if not removed.

SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS	= YES
