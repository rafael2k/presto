 <h2>Used OOM policies / Who is handling OOM?</h2>
 <p>
  All functions in the various classes in the module that comprise its
  public API that can fail due to OOM signal such failures by
  returning

    <code>OpStatus::ERR_NO_MEMORY</code>.

  In such case, the caller is responsible for handling the out of
  memory condition.

  When an out of memory condition occurs in a call directly from the
  message loop (this includes, for instance, all out of memory
  conditions signalled by the ECMAScript execution engine,) OOM is
  signalled through a call to

    <code>Window::RaiseCondition</code>

  or

    <code>MemoryManager::RaiseCondition</code>

  (the latter if the ECMAScript environment is not one connected to a
  document.)

  When an asynchronous operation started through the

    <code>ES_AsyncInterface</code>

  interface fails due to OOM, this is (in addition to what is
  described above) signalled by calling the registered callback with
  the status

    <code>ES_ASYNC_NO_MEMORY</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to propagating OOM signals to outside the module, out of
  memory conditions that occur while executing threads are also
  handled by killing all threads in the affected scheduler (thus
  returning it to its initial state.)
 </p>

 <h2>Description of flow</h2>
 <p>
  The code flow in the module is divided into two main cases:
 </p>
 <dl>
  <dt>Called from external code</dt>
  <dd>
    Calls from external code (code in other modules) primarily
    initiate new operations by allocating the necessary objects,
    compiling ECMAScript programs and posting messages to the message
    loop.

    Typical important entry points are

      <ol>
        <li><code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl::AddRunnable</code></li>
        <li><code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl::AddWaiting</code></li>
        <li><code>ES_AsyncInterface::Eval</code></li>
        <li><code>ES_LoadManager::RegisterScript</code></li>
        <li><code>ES_LoadManager::SetScript</code></li>
        <li><code>ES_LoadManager::Write</code></li>
      </ol>

    Functions 3 through 6 typically allocate significant amounts of
    memory and are thus likely to be handling OOM.

  </dd>

  <dt>Called from message loop</dt>
  <dd>
    Calls from the message loop do most of the real work, by
    evaluating threads and possibly calling the ECMAScript execution
    engine to execute code.

    The typical call chain is

      <ol>
       <li>&lt;<i>Message loop</i>&gt;</li>
       <li><code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl::HandleCallback</code></li>
       <li><code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl::RunNow</code></li>
       <li><code>ES_Thread::Evaluate</code></li>
       <li>&lt;<i>ECMAScript execution engine</i>&gt;</li>
      </ol>

    Out of memory conditions that occur during ECMAScript execution or
    in DOM code will be propagated out from the ECMAScript execution
    engine at 5, handled internally by 3 (through a call to

      <code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl::HandleError</code>)

    and then propagated out of the module by 2.
  </dd>
 </dl>

 <h2>Heap memory usage</h2>
 <p>
  Most memory allocated is used for control structures such as thread
  schedulers

    (<code>ES_ThreadSchedulerImpl</code>)

  and threads

    (<code>ES_Thread</code>

   and subclasses) and for script generated document data (text
  written by a script through a call to either of the functions
  "document.write" and "document.writeln".)  While both thread
  schedulers and threads are fairly large objects, there are normally
  few alive at any given time (at most one scheduler per document, and
  zero or more threads per thread scheduler.)  Threads are deallocated
  as soon as they finish executing.  The amount of script generated
  document data depends entirely on scripts on the page.  There is no
  upper limit.  Script generated document data is allocated in blocks
  of fixed size (see "Memory tuning") and freed (blockwise) as soon as
  it has been consumed by the document (HTML or XML) parser.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some threads own potentially large heap allocated structures from
  the ECMAScript module, represented by

    <code>ES_Context</code>

  and

    <code>ES_Program</code>

  objects.  Such objects are freed by the threads when the threads are
  deallocated.  Most memory referenced by such objects are probably
  owned and freed by the ECMAScript garbage collector at an unknown
  time after the objects have been freed.
 </p>

 <h2>Stack memory usage</h2>
 <p>
  The module uses insignificant amounts of stack memory.  There are no
  complex recursive functions or stack allocated arrays larger than a
  few bytes.
 </p>

 <h2>Caching and freeing memory</h2>
 <p>
  The module has no caching, and there is no non-destructive way to
  free memory.  It is possible to kill all currently alive threads and
  thus free them and memory referenced from them by calling the
  function ES_ThreadScheduler::RemoveThreads.
 </p>

 <h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>
 <p>
  Freeing memory on exit is dependant on that someone else frees all

    <code>ES_ThreadScheduler</code>

  and

    <code>ES_Environment</code>

  objects.  This is typically the responsibility of the DOM module (in
  the case of thread schedulers) and whatever code that created the

    <code>ES_Environment</code>

   object (currently only Voice XML code does that.)
 </p>

 <h2>Temporary buffers</h2>
 <p>
  The module uses the shared buffer returned by the function

    <code>MemoryManager::GetTempBuf</code>.

  In one case it is simply to avoid having to allocate a separate
  string (pure optimization that is easy to remove) and in all other
  cases the shared buffer is used to return a generated string from a
  function without making the caller (which is in the ECMAScript
  module) responsible for deallocating the returned string.  Changing
  this requires either using a non-shared but still globally allocated
  buffer, or to rewrite the function and the code that calls it so
  that the caller deallocates the string.
 </p>

 <h2>Memory tuning</h2>
 <p>
  The class load manager (ES_LoadManager) uses a list of blocks to
  store script generated data.  The size of the blocks in that list
  depends on the tweak TWEAK_ESUTILS_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE. No other memory
  tuning is possible.
 </p>

 <h2>Tests</h2>
 <p>
  There are no tests specificly for testing memory usage.
 </p>

 <h2>Coverage</h2>
 <p>
  Running the "Scheduler regression tests" in the jstest2 CVS module
  and the selftests in the ECMAScript Utils module ("ESUtils.*")
  should provide good coverage for the code that is likely to be
  handling out of memory conditions.
 </p>

 <h2>Design choices</h2>
 <p>
  There are no design choices in the module's design relating directly
  to balancing memory usage, footprint, performance and/or design.  Or
  put differently: essentially no compromises between the different
  priorities have been made.
 </p>

 <h2>Suggestions of improvements</h2>
 <p>
  There are currently no planned improvements with regards to memory
  handling.
