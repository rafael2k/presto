<h1>The minpng module</h1>

<h3>API Documentation</h3>
For details about this module see the 
<a href='api/index.html'>Doxygen generated API documentation</a>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>The minpng module decodes and encodes PNG-images. The decoder supports
all image formats (color-formats/bpp) specified in the PNG specification
as input and outputs image data in RGBA or indexed-color format. It also
supports animated pngs (APNG).
The encoder, on the other hand, is sort of minimalistic and does only
support input in the form of RGBA data and outputs PNG data in color
formats 2 (truecolor) and 6 (truecolor with alpha).</p>

<p>minpng depends on the zlib module.</p>

<h3>Where is minpng used in Opera?</h3>

<p>The minpng decoder is used by the img module to decode animations and images 
on web-pages or in the UI.</p>

<p>The minpng encoder is used by the canvas module to implement the toDataUrl
method for HTMLCanvasElement according to the specification of the canvas
element.</p>

<p>The encoder is also used by CoreGogi to take screenshots in the form of PNG
images for the purpose of regression testing.</p>

<h3>Design goals and implementation strategies</h3>

<p>The design of the external api for minpng as well as the internals has been 
focused on providing a simple api based around one function (minpng_decode
for the decoder and minpng_encode for the encoder) that supports partitial
encoding/decoding, that is - the user don't need to supply all input data
at one, but can instead "chunk it up" into smaller portions for feeding the
decoder/encoder chunk by chunk. The purpose of this is to permit loading of
images to begin before the full image has been (down)loaded, and also for not
stalling Opera while e.g. decoding large images (or animations).</p>

<p>The strategy for implementing this goal has been to implement the decoder and
encoders as "state machines", with an internal state that keeps track of the
decoding/encoding process so that minpng knows where to continue when being 
called multiple times for decoding/encoding of the same image.</p>

<p>The state is recorded internally in minpng as the structs minpng_state (for
the decoder) and minpng_encoder_state (for the encoder). These struct keep track
of the current decoding/encoding progress, e.g. "has the png header been processed
yet" or "how many scanlines have been decoded so far", etc.</p>

<p>The other important structs used are the PngFeeder and PngRes structs (for the 
decoder), and the PngEncFeeder and PngEncRes structs (for the encoder). These are
used to "feed" the decoder/encoder with png data/uncompressed scanlines which will
generate the result in the "result" structs as uncompressed scanlines/png data</p>

<p>The decoder are in general only keeping the part of the image which should be 
returned to the caller for the current call to minpng_decode in memory as decoded 
image data. The exception is while decoding interlaced PNG images, then does
minpng need to keep data from previous interlace-passes in memory in order to
compose the final deinterlaced output image data.</p>

<h3>Memory and testing</h3>

<h4>Used OOM policies</h4> 

minpng is organized as a library, and as such returns a special status
code from minpng_decode (PngRes::OOM_ERROR) or minpng_encode 
(PngEncRes::OOM_ERROR) when an OOM error occurs.

<h4>Who is handling OOM?</h4> 

When minpng_decode or minpng_encode returns OOM_ERROR, then is the caller 
responsible of freeing up memory by calling minpng_clear_result and
minpng_clear_feeder, or in the encoding case minpng_clear_encoder_result
and minpng_clear_encoder_feeder (as well as the 'result' and 'feeder'
structs themselves of course...).

<h4>Description of flow</h4> 

When an OOM error occurs in the module, the error will be immediately 
propagated up to the caller of minpng_decode or minpng_encode.

<h4>Heap memory usage</h4> 

<p>When decoding interlaced images, a temporary buffer sized width *
height * 4 bytes is used to store the deinterlace progress.</p>

<p> Normally the memory usage depends on the amount of data that is
fed to the module at a time, it allocates aproximately (width *
number_of_lines_in_current_data * 4) bytes of memory for the decoded
image, and on average (uncompressed_size * 1.2) bytes of memory for
the decoding buffer.</p>

<a name="tips"></a>
<p> The interlace image buffer is still there, though. It can be
removed by adding a box-drawing interface to the img objects. This
would probably only be useful when the footprint requirements are very
strict.</p>

<p> The decoding state is kept in heap memory, and occupies around 32
bytes of memory.</p>

<h4>Stack memory usage</h4> 

There are no deep callstacks or large stack buffers in the minpng
module. The worst case is around 1Kb used stack.

<h4>Static memory usage</h4> 

There is no static memory usage at all.

<h4>Caching and freeing memory</h4>

All cached data will be freed by minpng_clear_result and minpng_clear_feeder, 
or in the encoding case minpng_clear_encoder_result and minpng_clear_encoder_feeder.
These functions can be called at any time between calls to minpng_decode and
minpng_encode.

<h4>Freeing memory on exit</h4> 

Because the encoder and decoder are not implemented as C++ classes, it's the user of
minpng who is responsible of clearing the structs as mentioned above.

<h4>Temp buffers</h4> 

There are no temp buffers.

<h4>Memory tuning</h4> 

No tuning possible, sorry...

<h4>Tests</h4>

The testsuite includes the complete png-testsuite from the official
png site as well as a couple of smoketests. PNG images are decoded
and compared to identical raw-imagedata reference images during selftest.

<h4>Coverage</h4>

The testsuite covers everything about decoding except the OOM handling.

<h4>Design choices</h4>

The design choice which matters the most for memory usage is the kind of image data
to output from the decoder, here we stick to the ones used by OpBitmap (32-bit RGBA 
and 8-bit indexed).

<h4>Suggestions of improvements</h4>

<h3>Using minpng</h3>

Sample minpng decoding usage code (including the 'AGAIN' handling, and a hypotetical 'Image' class):


<pre>// The Image class is something that only exists in this example (not the Image class in the img module... )
bool decode_image( Image img, void *png_data, int png_data_len )
{
    bool finished=false, inited=false;
    Image img;
    PngFeeder feeder;
    PngRes result;

    feeder.data = png_data;
    feeder.len = png_data_len;

    // Clear the result struct
    minpng_clear_result(&result);
    while( !finished && feeder.len > 0 )
    { 
        bool again = true;
        while( again )
        {
            switch( minpng_decode( &feeder, &result ) )
            {
               case PngRes::OK:
                 finished=true;
               case PngRes::NEED_MORE: // Assumes all data we have were present in png_data
                 again=false; 
               case PngRes::AGAIN: // Note all the intentional fallthroughs
                for( int i = 0; i&lt;(int)result.lines; i++ )
                {
                   // Intentionally here. Avoid calling init if we do not have at least one line
                    if( !inited ) {
                         inited = true;
                         // If minpng has outputted indexed image data will result.image_frame_data_pal
                         // specify a palette as a byte array in the format r0,g0,b0,r1,g1,b,1...etc.
                         // result.has_transparent_col and result.transparent_index will give information
                         // about a possibly transparent color (index).
                         img.Init( result.mainframe_x, result.mainframe_y, result);
                    }
// Indexed output is only sent if this macro is defined
#if defined(SUPPORT_INDEXED_OPBITMAP)
                    // indexed image data outputted from minpng
                    if(result.image_frame_data_pal != NULL) 
                        img.AddLine( i+result.first_line, result.image_data.indexed+i*result.mainframe_x );
                    // RGBA or BGRA image data
                    else 
#endif // SUPPORT_INDEXED_OPBITMAP
                        img.AddLine( i+result.first_line, result.image_data.rgba+i*result.mainframe_x );
                }
                break;
              case PngRes::OOM_ERROR:
              case PngRes::ILLEGAL_DATA:
                return false;
            }
            minpng_clear_result(&result);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</pre>


<h3>Future plans</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Less memory usage, if possible (quite low already, but could be better)
  <li>MNG, APNG
</ul>
