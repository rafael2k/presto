<h1>cppgen - Code generator</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>cppgen is a Python package which takes care of generating the
necessary C++ classes/files from the proto files. The package is
designed to be reused in custom tools but is also integrated with the
operasetup system. This makes it easy to use proto files as the C++
files are generated when a new build is started. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>cppgen requires Python 2.4 or higher (untested in Python 3), no
external libraries are needed</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>The Python package is located in modules/protobuf/cppgen. The main
starting point is in the script.py file, both the CLI script and the
operasetup call happens via this file.</p>

<p>The files in the package are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cpp.py - General code for generating C++ code</li>
	<li>extension.py - The extension registration file for hob, no longer needed</li>
	<li>message.py - Handles generation of C++ classes from protobuf messages</li>
	<li>op_message.py - Handles generation of OpMessage classes</li>
	<li>scope_manager.py - Handles generation of the global scope manager class</li>
	<li>scope_service.py - Handles generation of scope services</li>
	<li>script.py - The main logic for the generator</li>
	<li>utils.py - Various utility functions/classes</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally the package also contains selected files from the
external tool called <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hob">hob</a>,
these files handles parsing of the .proto files into Python structures.
Care must be taken to avoid modifying these files, if they are modified
then the updates must also be applied to hob. These files are located in
the <em>ext/hob</em> subfolder.</p>

<p>The tests subfolder contains unittests (run by nose) but is currently
outdated.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>The generator can be started in three ways. The first is by calling
the script.py file using Python, it has several options, use -h to get
an overview. Calling the script is safe as it only checks what files
needs to created or updated. The second is via the operasetup process,
this will generate/update the code when run. The third is an extension
to hob, this is how the tool was originally used and is no longer
relevant.It should be removed in the future. </p>

<p>Example run - Display files which are to be created or updated.</p>

<code>python modules/protobuf/cppgen/script.py</code>

<p>A useful option is the --diff option, if supplied it changes the
output to show the difference between the current codebase and what will
be updated. This is quite handy when modifying the cppgen generator, you
should be able to spot mistakes quite quickly.</p>

<code>python modules/protobuf/cppgen/script.py --diff</code>

<p>Running it via operasetup is normally done when starting a new build,
but it also possible by calling
<em>modules\hardcore\scripts\operasetup.py</em></p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The generator can be configured on a per-module basis by creating a
file called cpp.conf in the root of the module. It controls how the
generated code looks like for that module, e.g. to add additional helper
methods or change names to avoid conflicts. For more details see
<a href="../cpp.conf">cpp.conf</a> </p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The generator consists of several steps, they are:</p>

<h3>Discovery</h3>

<p>The first step is to scan the modules in the source tree for proto
files. This is done by looking for <em>modules.proto</em> files in each
module. This file contains a list of filenames or directories which are
to be included, if a directory is specified it will include all files
which look like proto files (ends in .proto). The system will also find
proto files in non-core setups, for instance Desktop adds new scope
services.</p>

<p>Each <em>module.proto</em> is scanned by stripping away comments
(starts with a #) and inspecting each line in the file. An example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# The following files are included
# The ecmascript service
ecmascript.proto

# Include all .proto files in the services sub-folder
services
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is handled by <em>script.ProtobufSystem.scan</em>.</p>

<h3>Parsing</h3>

<p>Once all files are known the system parses the proto files and builds
a structure for each one. The result will be placed in cache files by
pickling the Python structure to speed up parsing the next time it is
run.  The parsing is handled by <em>script.ProtoFile.loadPackage</em> or
<em>script.ProtoFile.loadCache</em>.</p>

<p>After the proto structure is available it builds the corresponding
C++ structure by attaching objects representing the C++ classes, enums
and other types (see <em>cpp.py</em>). This is initiated by
<em>script.ProtoFile.scan</em> by calling <em>cpp.buildCppElements</em>
on the package object. It will iterate over all proto objects and attach
a builder object (subclass of <em>cpp.CppBuilder</em>). Each builder
object contains a set of properties and methods which the generators
will later on use, for instance they can return the names of C++ types
or objects representing types (e.g. an enum). The builder is accessible
on the proto object via the <em>cpp</em> property. </p>

<p>Any message which is marked as an OpMessage will be added to a
<em>script.OpMessageSystem</em> which will be processed after the scan
is done. This is needed to generate global unique IDs for each
OpMessage.</p>

<h3>Generate</h3>

<p>The final step is to generate the C++ code and write them out to the
.cpp and .h files. The system is designed to avoid writing to the files
if no changes are found, this is very important as the build systems
used by Opera will always recompile any changed C++ file, in some cases
the entire source tree will be recompiled. The system also tries to
figure out if it even needs to parse and generate the code to speed up
the process. This has in some cases in the past led to problems were
code were not updated, see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
below for more details.</p>

<p>What gets generated depends on what is found in the proto files. For
instance if a service declaration is found it assumes it is a scope
service and will use <em>scope_service.py</em>, if it finds messages
marked as <em>OpMessage</em> it will use <em>op_message.py</em>. Both of
them will use <em>message.py</em> to generate the C++ classes for the
messages but will embed the generated code in different ways. They are
currently mutually exclusive, this is something that could be improved
in the future, for instance by having the message classes in a separate
namespace/class and generate the service or OpMessage classes if
needed.</p>

<p>Additionally a global service manager class is created, it keeps
track of all service classes in the system and manages object lifetime
and service registration. This is generated by <em>scope_manager.py</em>
and the <em>scope_manager.CppManagerGenerator</em> class. This
manager is used in the scope module only.</p>

<h2>Generators</h2>

<p>The various generators used in the system are explained in more
detail below.</p>

<h3>Proto messages</h3>

<p>Each message which are found in the proto files (including nested ones)
will be converted to a C++ class which represents the message file. The
C++ class will for the most part reflect the message by having members
with similar names to the fields. All messages are placed in an outer
class called the message-set, ideally this should have been a namespace
but that cannot be used yet.</p>

<p>
The nested structure of the messages are not reflected in the C++ code
as there are problems referencing classes which have not yet been defined.
Instead a flat structure is used with the name of the C++ class reflecting
the nested structure, for instance consider following structure:
</p>

<pre>
message Points
{
	message Point
	{
	}
}
</pre>

<p>The inner message <em>Point</em> will get a name reflecting the
entire path of the message, i.e. the class would be named something like
<em>Points_Point</em>. To make it easier for the C++ developers
additional typedefs are added to mimic the original structure, e.g. a
typedef is placed inside the Points class to the <em>Points_Point</em>
class but with the name <em>Point</em>, this makes it possible to
reference the class with just <em>Points::Point</em>. </p>

<p>The generator is handled by <em>message.py</em> and the Python class
<em>CppMessageGenerator</em>. It generates a list of C++ methods by
inspecting the message fields, their types and their options. </p>

<h3>Service generation</h3>

<p>The services are generated by the
<em>scope_service.CppServiceGenerator</em> class, it generates both the
header and implementation code. The class
<em>scope_service.CppScopeServiceGenerator</em> handles configuration
and knows which files to generate.</p>

<h3>OpMessage generation</h3>

<p>Each marked proto message will be converted to a C++ class which is a
subclass of <em>OpTypedMessage</em>. It will first generate the class
for the proto message itself using <em>message.py</em>, then it will
generate the OpMessage wrapper class which contains the specific methods
and constructors, the actual data is stored in a private member using
the generated proto class. The Python class
<em>CppOpMessageGenerator</em> is responsible for generating the files,
while the classes <em>CppOpMessageDeclaration</em> and
<em>CppOpMessageImplementation</em> handles the actual code generation.
All generated classes for a single module is placed in a message-set,
this is handled by <em>CppOpMessageSetGenerator</em>. </p>

<p>All OpMessages in the system are assigned a unique enum which is used
for knowing which type a serialized message has. The Python class
<em>CppOpMessageGlobalGenerator</em> handles the generated files for
this system and the generator are handled by the classes
<em>CppOpTypedMessageBaseDeclaration</em> and
<em>CppOpTypedMessageBaseImplementation</em> </p>

<h3>cpp</h3>

<p>The <em>cppgen</em> module contains lots of functionality for
representing C++ code as Python objects and generating text output from
them. All C++ elements inherit from the CppElement class, it maintains a
child/parent relationship and has convenience properties for docblocks,
comments, spacing and a link to the Proto object (if any) that it was
created from. Several subclasses exists such as Class, Enum, Method and
TypeDef, however it does not cover all C++ types and keywords (yet).

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Corrupt code</h3>

<p>There has been some issues in the past with code being corrupted at
times. This problem comes from the caching and mtime checking which
has caused only some files to be updated. The result is that the compiler
will only recompile those modified files leaving existing files untouched.
When the code is linked there may be different offsets used for fetching
attributes in objects leading to memory corruption.
The main cause of this issue has been switching between changesets in
git which contain different versions of the protobuf Python module.
</p>

<p>The easy fix to this is to clear the cache folder/files and run
operasetup again. The proper fix is to change the build system as
outlined in Future Improvements.</p>


<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<h3>Python cleanup</h3>

<p>The current Python code is a mix of coding styles and should be
standardized to just one. The best would be to use the
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> standard.
</p>

<h3>C++ generation</h3>

<p>The code generation to C++ is a mix of C++ Python objects and direct
text output. When the generator was first created it relied only on
text/template output and the C++ objects was added little by little
afterwards. Ideally the generation should be made by creating the Python
C++ objects only and then serializing them to text. Doing that will
require adding more CppElement subclasses and improving existing ones as
well as convert a lot of the old manual text output to use the new
system.</p>

<p>For instance it could all start with a File object which contains
CppElements, such as:</p>

<pre>
File
  - Comment
  - MacroIf
      - Class
        - Method
        - Method
        ...
</pre>

<p>Then all that needs to be done is serialize the File object.</p>

<h3>Unified message-sets</h3>

<p>Currently the scope service generator creates the message-set a bit
different than the one created when no service is defined. The best
solution would be to always create the message-set outside the service
class and make the service file reuse that. Ideally all message-sets
should be managed by the protobuf module, currently the scope module
manages the message-sets found in services.</p>

<h3>Improved build process</h3>

<p>Currently <em>script.py</em> partially implements its own build system
by keeping track of dependencies and managing mtime and pickle caches.
This makes the codebase bigger than it needs to be and it also contains
bugs from time to time.
The better approach would be to separate the process, the first run would
only take care of discovering proto files and writing out a set of text
files which contain information about which proto files are to be used.
For instance there could be one file listing all proto files which are
used to generate message-sets, another for scope services and a third
for OpMessages, these files could also contain dependency information.
The real build system will then use that information to generate the files
if needed (mtime, dependencies etc.) by calling specific Python scripts,
e.g. "generate_messages.py".
</p>

<h3>Fix imports</h3>

<p>Currently the protobuf import mechanism is a bit lacking. The system
will import proto files from the current working directory instead of
either relative to the current file or from the root of the opera source
tree. This could potentially be fixed by setting up a list of include
paths and use these paths to find the file to include.
</p>

<h3>More C++ customizations</h3>

<p>The customization of the generated code could be improved. For
instance supporting setting a list of C++ include files to be added to
all generated files or just for a given .proto file.
