 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>
  The <em>Prefsfile module</em> provides APIs for reading and writing the
  Opera configuration file formats directly, and support for language files.
  This is used mainly by the
  <a href="../../prefs/documentation/index.html">Preferences module</a>,
  but also several other parts of the code.
 </p>
 <p>

  information about the Prefsfile module</a> and its releases is available

 <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a> is the
  general-purpose configuration storage API used by the
  <a href="../../prefs/documentation/index.html">Preferences module</a>
  (and others) to store configuration options on disk.
  Platforms that want to re-implement the reading of preferences (for instance
  using system APIs) can
  <a href="#changingfileformat">implement new file formats</a>
  inside the PrefsFile framework by implementing the
  <a href="api/index.html#prefsaccessor">PrefsAccessor</a>
  interface.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a> class implements
  support for <a href="background.html">cascading preferences</a> using
  several preferences files.
 </p>

 <h2 id="usecases">Use-cases</h2>

 <h3 id="readinganauxiliaryinifile">Reading auxiliary <code>INI</code>
  files/file sets</h3>
 <p>
  To read an auxiliary preferences file (normally in
  <code><abbr title="initialisation">INI</abbr></code> or
  <code><abbr title="language">LNG</abbr></code> format), an instance of
  <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a> class is constructed
  and initialised.
  When creating the object, the type of the file must be supplied.
  For core code, the special constant <code>PREFS_STD</code> should always be
  used when it needs to access files, as this will always select the platform
  default type (configurable through the tweak system).
 </p>
 <p>
  After performing a <code>PrefsFile::LoadAllL()</code>, the instance of
  PrefsFile permits direct access to the settings stored in the
  <code>INI</code> (or <code>LNG</code>)
  file using the various <code>Read*()</code> methods, and to write (not
  <code>LNG</code>) using the <code>Write*</code> methods.
  To store the modified file to disk, <code>PrefsFile::CommitL()</code>
  is called.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that as long as the PrefsFile object is not flushed, either
  by <code>PrefsFile::CommitL()</code> or a direct call to
  <code>PrefsFile::Flush()</code>, any changes done to the file on-disk
  will be ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  For more details on how to use preferences files and an explanation of
  how the design is supposed to work, please see the
  <a href="background.html">background information</a>.
 </p>

 <h3 id="changingfileformat">Changing file formats</h3>
 <p>
  The PrefsFile class is not tied to using a specific file format for storing
  its preferences, all reading and writing to the actual files is performed
  by the <a href="api/index.html#prefsaccessor">PrefsAccessor</a> interface.
  The requirement when changing both the file format and storage method is
  that data can be stored keyed to a <em>section</em> and <em>key</em>, and
  that the data types that can be written are at least strings and numbers
  (in PrefsAccessor and associated classes, all preferences are written as
  strings).
 </p>

 <h2 id="supportedstandards">Supported standards</h2>
 <p>
  The file format used by <code>IniAccessor</code> is based on the standard
  Windows <code>INI</code> file format, with some extensions.
  The language file format is an extended <code>INI</code> file format with
  embedded encoding information, and is used by the
  <a href="../../locale/documentation/index.html">locale code</a>.
 </p>

  <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a>.

 <h3 id="memorymanagement">Memory management</h3>
 <h4 id="heapusage">Heap usage</h4>

 <p>
  Footprint usage can be decreased by disabling hashing code.
  Memory usage will decrease as well, as the data associated with the hash
  tables is no longer used.
  Memory and footprint usage will be decreased further when
  enabling case sensitive preference key names.
 </p>

 <p>
  These settings also affect performance, and can be manually tuned,
  see "<a href="#performance">Performance</a>" below for more details.
 </p>

 <h4 id="stackusage">Stack usage</h4>
 <p>
  There are no recursive calls.
 </p>

 <h4 id="staticmemoryusage">Static memory usage</h4>
 <p>
  There is one global <code>PrefsHashFunctions</code> pointer,
  which is live for the entire lifetime of Opera (under certain
  circumstances it might even be initialised before the call
  <code>InitL</code>).
 </p>
 <p>
  There is also a temporary buffer used for case conversion and environment
  variable expansion.
  This buffer is of 4096 <code>uni_char</code>s if expansion of environment
  variables is enabled, or of 2048 <code>uni_char</code>s if case
  insensitive name look-up are used.
  If neither expansion nor case insensitivity is enabled, this buffer is not
  enabled.
 </p>

 <h4 id="oompolicies"><abbr title="Out of memory">OOM</abbr> policies</h4>
 <p>
  The vast majority of functions that require memory to be allocated is
  using the <code>TRAP</code>/<code>LEAVE</code> convention.
 </p>

 <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
 <h4 id="caching">Caching</h4>
 <p>
  To make reading and writing from preference files faster, the files are
  cached inside the <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a>
  class.
 </p>

 <h4 id="hashing">Hashing</h4>
 <p>
  Furthermore, <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a> uses
  hash tables to make lookup into the parsed files faster.
  For small machines, this should probably be disabled, and the linear
  search used.
  The coded needs to retain the linear ordering of the preferences
  anyway.
 </p>
  For most devices with large ini files it is probably a good idea to
  enabled <code>FEATURE_PREFS_ENTRIES_HASH</code> (hashing of keys in a
  section) and <code>FEATURE_PREFS_SECTION_HASH</code> (hashing of
  sections), if the increased memory usage can
  be afforded.
  Hashing of sections is not normally necessary unless ini files with a
  large number of sections is used (e.g skinning files).
 </p>
 <p>
  Language files are read sequentially by the LanguageManager
  implementation, so no performance penalty is induced for language files if
  hashing is removed, even for large language files.
 </p>

 <h4 id="case">Case sensitivity</h4>
 <p>
  Normally the section and key names in the preference files are case
  insensitive (in a normal Windows <code>INI</code> file, case is not
  considered), to make it easier to edit these files by hand.
  If you enable <code>TWEAK_PF_CASE_SENSITIVE</code>, the strings are
  made case sensitive, speeding up the related string comparisons.
  For devices where the user or other software will not be touching the
  preference files this should probably be enabled.
  This is especially useful when hashing is disabled.
