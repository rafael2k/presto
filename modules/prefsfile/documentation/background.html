  The cascade.
 </p>

 <h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
 <p>
  A central concept in the design of the Prefsfile module is <em>the cascade</em>
  of preferences, which is named so after the similar concept in
  <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
  Basically this means that there are several layers of preferences available,
  that can be set by different people.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cascade is implemented in the
  <a href="api/index.html#prefsfile">PrefsFile</a> class, which is the
  main interface used by most platforms.
  Some platforms may implement their own code in place of PrefsFile, but that
  is beyond the scope of this documentation.
 </p>

 <h4 id="fourlevel">Four-level cascade</h4>
 <p>
  The cascade used in <code>PrefsFile</code> involves three levels of files
  and the compiled-in defaults.
  This four-level cascade is indicated with the black arrows in the diagram.
  When requesting the value of a setting, these three file levels will be checked
  in order, returning the value from the first file found.
 </p>

 <h4 id="twolevel">Two-level cascade</h4>
 <p>
  It is possible to disable the cascade by disabling the
  <code>FEATURE_PREFS_CASCADE</code> setting.
  In this case, only the user settings file and the built-in settings will be
  used, as indicated by the blue arrows in the diagram.
  This mode of operation is typically used on system where there is no concept
  of system administrator, or where such support is not needed, mainly in
  embedded deliveries.
 </p>

 <h3 id="fixed">The system fixed preferences</h3>
 <p>
  The global fixed files contains settings that the user running Opera is not
  allowed to change, and is aimed for system administrators that want to enforce
  certain settings on the user, to disable certain features or enable the
  use of others.
  There can be any number of global fixed files in the cascade, the number is
  specified in the call to the constructor for the PrefsFile class.
  The files are searched in the priority order given when setting up the
  PrefsFile object, with 0 being the highest priority.
  These files should normally be placed in a directory where normal users do not
  have write access.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you try to write to a preference that is defined in one of the global fixed files,
  nothing will be changed and an error code will be returned to the caller.
  There is an API called <code>AllowedToChangeL()</code> which checks if the
  setting is not set in the global fixed file.
 </p>

 <h3 id="user">The user preferences</h3>
 <p>
  This is the regular preferences file (for the main configuration usually
  called <code>opera.ini</code> or something similar), which the user has
  access to and can edit.
  On regular desktop systems, the user will normally have access to edit this
  file manually.
  Changes done using the regular write methods will end up in this file,
  unless they are blocked by the
  <a href="#fixed">global fixed preferences</a> as described above.
  There can be only one user preference file.
 </p>

 <h3 id="global">The global default preferences</h3>
 <p>
  The global preferences files contains fallback settings, and can be set by
  the installer or by the system administrator to provide defaults that
  are tailored for that particular installation.
  The installers usually use this to set paths to files that can move depending
  on the installation, and the system administrator can use this to set a
  default home page to replace the regular Opera portal page.
 </p>
 <p>
  There can be any number of global files in the cascade, the number is
  specified in the call to the constructor for the PrefsFile class.
  The files are searched in the priority order given when setting up the
  PrefsFile object, with 0 being the highest priority.
  This can be used, for instance, to allow for several levels of fallback,
  one created by the installer, one depending on the user's locale, and
  so on.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you enable the corresponding tweak setting, it is also possible to write
  to these files from inside Opera.
  This should be handled with care, but can be useful when you need to make a
  distinction between settings changed by the user and automatic settings, for
  instance settings downloaded from a server.
 </p>

 <h3 id="code">Built-in compile- or run-time defaults</h3>
 <p>
  The lowest level of the preference cascade is defined at compile or run
  time by using the default value argument to the reader methods.
  When the settings requested is not available in any of the files defined by
  the cascade, the default value will be returned instead.
