== Improvements =====================

* Update UI-button directly instead of waiting until the page is loaded.
* submit directly without blocking webpage
* If we choose "never on this page" or "never on this server" we should remove all previous entrys
  for the page or server.
* Optimize FindMatch (no linear search?).
* Smarter matching if the formnr is not correct but url is matching.
* Update has_wand_matches in document (so uibutton change) when wandentries are removed.

== Features =========================

* Generate password
* Export/Import.
* Solve Endianness when loading (so same wand.dat can be used on win & mac).
