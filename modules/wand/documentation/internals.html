<h1>Wand internals</h1>

<h2>Internal structure</h2>

There is one WandManager. It's a global object but it would in theory
be possible to have several of them.

<h2>WandManager</h2>

Every WandManager owns a couple of profiles. Normally there are 2
profiles, the personal profile and the logged profile. These are saved
in WandProfile objects. The logged profile isn't directly
accessible. Instead one can access its pages (WandPage) directly with
GetWandPage() and GetWandPageCount().

<h3>WandProfile</h3>

Every profile has a number of pages. Every page is a "form" though in
the case of the personal profile it may be a form in the UI rather
than a form on a web page. Every such page is saved in a WandPage object.

<h4>WandPage</h4>

In a WandPage there are information to identify the origins (page url,
action url, top document url, submit button, click position) and a
number of info objects named WandObjectInfo.

<h5>WandObjectInfo</h5>

A WandObjectInfo stores a name value pair, though with slight
tweak. The value may be a heavily encrypted password (or atleast
obfuscated).
