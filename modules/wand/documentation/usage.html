<h1>Wand</h1>

Wand is used to store passwords so that users don't have to enter them
manually whenever a site asks for username and password. It's highly
dependant on a UI for it's job, but the core module contains storage
code and interaction with document and forms.

<h2>Security</h2>

The wand code contains sensitive data and therefore we either encrypt
it or obscurify it but since it's data that must exist on a web page
during a submit, it's not top secret. The easiest way to extract a
forgotten password is to initiate a submit but abort it before the
page has loaded. Then use a javascript url (or bookmarklet) to output
the contents of password fields.

<h2>Future improvements</h2>

Storing a possword shouldn't block the page load. This way we ask
people to store data before the server has verified that the data was
correct.
