description:

This module contains the interfaces that need to be implemented by a
platform in order for Opera to run. We try to keep the interface set
as small as possible so that it can be implemented and tested as
quickly as possible when we port to new platforms, i.e. pi is not a
library; it just specifies what a platform needs to implement for core.
