<h1>pi module documentation</h1>

<p>The pi (<q>Porting Interfaces</q>) module contains all interfaces for
everything that must be done in a platform-specific way, which thus
does not belong in core. Displaying text in a web page, for example,
requires usage of some font engine and painting in some sort of
windowing system, and it is up to the platform to decide how to do
this. All interfaces must be implemented when porting Opera to a new
platform; however, some of them may have been implemented in a
cross-platform manner inside core, and a platform may choose to use or
not use them. For example, there is a platform-independent host name
resolver in core (implementation of OpHostResolver) that acts as a DNS
client using OpSocket. There is also a concept called GOGI, which
implements the window management and painting classes (OpPainter,
OpView, OpBitmap, etc.) in a platform-independent way, so that all
that the actual platform needs to implement is a frame buffer
interface and some basic input events. GOGI is ideal for rapid porting
and/or when there is little benefit (performance, etc.) in making
native implementations of those classes.</p>

<p>The porting interfaces have developed during several years, and
have been adjusted and appended so that Opera has become more and more
portable.<p>

<h2>API documentation</h2>

<a href="api/index.html">Go to the API documentation</a>, generated
with Doxygen.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The porting interfaces were introduced in 2001 as a directory in
the Opera CVS module (Opera/Porting_Interfaces/). When core was
modularized a couple of years later, it was moved to the pi
module.</p>

<p>Prior to the introduction of porting interfaces, core had a lot of
ifdefs for each platform supported. Among other things, each platform
had their own version of VisualDevice, a class currently in the
display module, controlled by ifdefs. The same was true for the Comm
class in the url module. This sort of worked (although it became
really messy and difficult to maintain) when there were less than 5
platforms to support.</p>

<h2>Class categories</h2>

<p> The pi module consists of three main categories of classes: </p>

<ul>

 <li>The main classes - APIs for core usage, typically implemented on
 the platform side. The implementation of these classes carry out
 requests from core. (Example: OpSocket, OpPainter, OpSystemInfo)</li>

 <li>Listener or notifier classes, typically implemented in core and
 called from the platform side when certain events occur that core
 needs to know about (Example: OpSocketListener, OpMouseListener)</li>

 <li>Utility classes for passing complex datatypes between core and
 platform code (Example: OpRect)</li>

</ul>

<h2>What's in here?</h2>

<p>This module contains interfaces that core requires the platform to
implement, in order to work.</p>

<p> The porting interfaces cover the following basic platform dependencies
that Opera has, such as:</p>

<ul>

 <li>Networking</li>

 <li>Window management</li>

 <li>Painting</li>

 <li>Input events (mouse, keyboard)</li>

 <li>Font management</li>

 <li>File and folder handling</li>

 <li>DLL loading</li>

 <li>Getting time, date, or default protocol / file type handler</li>

 <li>... and more. Please see the <a href="api/index.html">API
 documentation</a> for more detail.</li>

</ul>

<p>This module also contains a Pike script that can be used to create
stub implementations of all the interfaces that are defined in this
module. This may save an implementor some amount of boring work when
porting Opera to a new platform, or when implementing a new
interface. The script is called make_stubs.pike</p>

<h2>What's NOT in here?</h2>

<p>APIs for user interface and product code are not in this
module. Such APIs belong in the windowcommander module. See the
chapter about <q><a href="#burger-model">The burger model</a></q>.</p>

  <p>(platform code)</p>
 </div>
 <div><p>The burger model</p></div>
</div>

<p>From a core-perspective[1], if we imagine Opera as a 3-layer
hamburger, the porting interfaces form the bottom bun of the
burger. This is the interface towards the platforms. The burger's
middle part, the meaty burger patty is Opera's core, and the top bun
is the interface towards the different user interfaces and general
product control. That part is taken care of by the windowcommander
module. The bottom layer varies with platform (Linux, Symbian, etc.),
the middle layer varies with feature settings (mouse support, ECMA
Script support, etc.), the top layer varies with product (desktop,
gogi).</p>

<p>Ownership-wise it goes like this: The product/UI owns core through
windowcommander (and hardcore for initialization and shutdown), core
owns the platform through pi.</p>

<p>Direction of requests or commands (<q>do this!</q>) in this model is
downwards. The product/UI requests/commands core to do something via
windowcommander (e.g. <q>go to URL</q>), core requests/commands the
platform to do something via pi (e.g. <q>connect to IP address</q>).</p>

<p>Direction of notifications (<q>this happened</q>) in this model is
upwards. The platform notifies core about events via pi (e.g. <q>data
received on socket</q>), core notifies the product/UI about events via
windowcommander (e.g. <q>70% of document loaded</q>). This is implemented
with methods in listener classes.</p>

<p>It follows from this model that core should never command the user
interface; instead it should notify it about events. That is, core
does not tell the user interface: <q>Display a top-aligned bar with red
Tahoma 12pt font on white background with the text '70% lastet'!</q>. No,
it tells the user interface <q>Just so you know, 70% of the document has
been loaded</q>. The the user interface code decides how to convey this
information to the user (if at all).</p>

<p class="note">[1] The burger model is useful to describe how it looks from
core's point of view. Outside of core, on the platform or product/UI
side (if there is such a distinction), platform and product/UI code
may meet, making it look more like a <q>hot dog model</q>, or even <q>French
hot dog model</q>. This is probably the case for gogi. The burger model
may be somewhat obscured to the gogi client, as gogi takes care of a
lot of the communication with (and implementation of) pi and
windowcommander, so that the platform/product implementor won't have
to bother so much about classes like e.g. OpWindowCommander and
OpPainter. Having said that, it probably makes sense to retain as much
as possible of the burger model idea on the platform / product side
too.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Design goals and scope</h2>

<p>The basic design goal is that no platform dependent code should
remain in core. This code should be abstracted and broken out into
proper porting interfaces. This way core code doesn't have to be
infested with platform #ifdefs.</p>

<p>What is considered <q>proper</q> is up for discussion in each case. One
needs to determine if an interface is more of a product/user
interface, than a platform interface. If it is, it should most likely
go into the top bun of the burger (see chapter about <q><a
href="#burger-model">The burger model</a></q>), i.e. the windowcommander
module. The pi module is and shall remain Opera core's only means of
interacting with the underlying (operating) system (and windowing
system). It shall not contain anything else.</p>

<p>All interfaces defined in this module shall be used by core in some
way or another; or they don't belong here. That is, interfaces that
indeed may be needed on several platforms from e.g. cross-platform
user interface code (such as QUICK), but that are not used in core
code, do not belong in the pi module. Such interfaces could belong in
mantle, or, in the case of the desktop version of Opera, perhaps the
desktop_pi module.</p>

<p>Another design goal is to keep the interface as small as
possible. We have no intentions of building a full, general-purpose
library; we only want whatever is needed to port Opera to any
platform. This is especially important because in principle, most of
the interfaces have to be implemented on every platform, from the
smallest web-capable earring or mobile phone, to the largest desktop
or web-capable meaning-of-life computing machine.</p>

<p>It is also important to choose a good level of abstraction; the
interface should be as generic as necessary and reasonable, but not
necessarily as generic as possible. (example: <q>Logitech mouse</q>,
<q>mouse</q>, <q>pointing device</q>, <q>input thingie</q>, or <q>body extension</q>?)</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should the platform implementation of
porting interfaces have to access global objects in core.[1]</p>

<p class="note">[1] This is currently not possible for a platform
implementation to achieve. To signal keyboard input, it needs to
access g_input_manager in the inputmanager module. A lot of platform
implementations also access g_prefsManager in the prefs
module.</p>

<h3>Data types and macros</h3>

<p>We should use as few data types as possible in the pi module, to
keep dependencies between core code and platform code at a
minimum. The pi module is however not entirely self-contained; some
essential data types and macros are provided by the hardcore and util
modules.</p>

<p>Types not defined in the pi module allowed in pi interfaces and
listeners:</p>

<ul>
 <li>OpString, OpString16, OpString8, OpStringC, OpStringC16, OpStringC8</li>
 <li>OpVector, OpINT32Vector, OpAutoVector</li>
 <li>OP_STATUS</li>
 <li>Anything defined by the type system in hardcore, such as OpFileLength, uni_char,  BOOL, etc.</li>
 <li>Types defined in the C++ language and library that are in accordance with the coding standard, such as int, size_t, struct tm, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Allowed core macros for the interface itself and the platform
implementation:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Anything defined in util/excepts.h, such as TRAP, TRAPD, LEAVE, RETURN_IF_ERROR, ANCHOR, ANCHOR_ARRAY</li>
 <li>UNI_L</li>
 <li>Defines controlled by the feature, system, API, tweak or capability system</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarded as design flaws, the following additional types are
currently used in pi:</p>

<ul>
 <li>OpMessage, MH_PARAM_1, MH_PARAM_2</li>
 <li>SVGPath</li>
 <li>OpFontInfo</li>
 <li>OpTypedObject</li>
 <li>OpInputAction, OpInputContext, OpInputManager</li>
 <li>OpFile</li>
 <li>UA_BaseStringId</li>
 <li>CursorType</li>
 <li>OpWidgetImage</li>
 <li>PrinterInfo</li>
 <li>FontAtt</li>
 <li>COLORREF</li>
</ul>

<h2>API changes</h2>

<p>Since practically everything in the pi module actually is some sort
of interface used or implemented by other modules, changing it will
normally affect other modules. For core modules, the regular
capability system is used to deal with API changes in pi. This way,
upgrading or downgrading pi or the module that a change affects, will
work smoothly and cause no compilation or runtime errors (if the
capability system is used properly). Changes in pi that affect
platform code will also be announced with a capability define, but
since platform code cannot announce capabilities, this only goes one
way, meaning that a change in pi will not wait for the platforms to
adapt. Platform code can retain backwards-compatiblity with older pi
module versions by checking for a capability announced by pi, but the
platform code is not forwards-compatible with future module
releases.</p>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>Each interface is a C++ class with only pure virtual
members[1]. Non-const pass-by-reference is implemented with
pointers[2], for code readability reasons. The idea is that it is more
obvious that parameter data is to be modified by the method if it is
passed as a pointer instead of as a reference. Note that this does not
apply to objects passed as const; we want to be able to do e.g.
<code>miff->Bar(OpRect(17,17,4711, 4711))</code> (where
<code>Bar</code> is declared as <code>virtual void Bar(const
OpRect&)</code>).</p>

<p>Each class name should start with the <q>Op</q> prefix. A main API class
along with its related listener classes (if any) should be put in a
header file with the same file name as the main class, with <q>.h</q>
appended. Capitalization in the class name is retained in the file
name. (Class OpFoo is found in file OpFoo.h)</p>

<p>A class name should consist of <q>Op</q> followed by a noun or a
compound noun.</p>

<p>A method name in a request class should resemble a command,
typically a clause starting with a verb in its imperative mood,
optionally followed by an object. Example: <q>Eat the burger!</q> &rarr;
EatBurger()</p>

<p>A method name in a listener class should start with <q>On</q> followed
by a clause in passive voice (only the participle), pretty much like a
newspaper headline. Example: <q>The burger was eaten by a horse</q> &rarr;
OnBurgerEatenByHorse()</p>

<p>Unless instances of a class are created by calling some method on a
manager class or owner object (e.g. OpFontManager::CreateFont()), the
class has a static Create() method, which creates (and initializes) an
instance of the class. It is implemented on the platform side,
typically along with the rest of the abstract class
re-implementation.</p>

<p class="note">[1] We have some members still remaining as non-pure
virtual, because people have historically taken shortcuts. Work is in
progress to fix that.</p>

<p class="note">[2] Normally true, and this is the rule to follow when
adding new methods or parameters to the interfaces. However, we still
have some methods that pass by reference using '&amp;' instead of
'*'.</p>

<h3>Coding style</h3>

<p>Tabs (4 spaces wide) are used for indentation.</p>

<p> Each class should be prefixed by doxygen documentation, on this format: </p>

<pre>
/** @short &lt;short description of class&gt;
 *
 * &lt;Additional information, if necessary. May span over several lines if
 * necessary&gt;
 */
class OpFoo
{
public:
    &lt;...&gt;
</pre>

... and each method should be prefixed like this:

<pre>
    /** &lt;short description of what the method does, starting with an verb in its imperative mood&gt;
     *
     * &lt;More detailed description of what the method does, if that is
     * necessary. May span over several lines&gt;
     *
     * @param a &lt;description of the 'a' parameter, which may span over
     * several lines&gt;
     * @param hest &lt;description of the 'hest' parameter&gt;
     *
     * @return &lt;possible return values&gt;
     */
    virtual OP_STATUS DoStuff(const uni_char* a, int hest) = 0;

    &lt;...&gt;
};
</pre>

<p>The width of comment lines should generally not exceed 80
characters (where each tab counts as 4 characters), but the <q>short
description</q> part of class or method documentation may, unless it is
ridiculously long (but then it's not really a short description, is
it?).</p>

<h2>Memory handling</h2>

<h3>Used OOM policies</h3>

The pi module normally signals OOM via OP_STATUS. In cases where the
surrounding core code relies heavily on TRAP/LEAVE, that mechanism is
used instead.

<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>

<p>The pi module does not need to deal much with OOM handling on its
own, since there's almost no code in there. The module initialization
sequence PiModule::InitL() may run out of memory, and if it happens,
it will propagate that via LEAVE.</p>

<p>OOM is signalled to callers of methods in the porting interface
classes. Methods in porting interface listener classes may never
signal OOM. In other words, platform code may report OOM to core code,
but not vice-versa.</p>

<h3>Description of flow</h3>

<p>Core calls a porting interface method. If the method signals OOM,
it is up to the caller to deal with that.</p>

<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>The module itself doesn't use heap memory at all, except for
whatever is required by the classes initialized in
PiModule::InitL(), and that shouldn't be much.</p>

<p>The platform code implementing the porting interface may use
considerable amounts of heap memory. This is the case especially for
OpBitmap. When core creates a new image object, the pixel data is
allocated and owned by the implementation of OpBitmap. OpFont may also
use a lot of heap memory. OpSocket may have to use some memory for
network buffering. OpView may have to use some for
double-buffering. There is no way for core to keep track of this kind
of memory usage, except for the OpBitmap case, where OpScreenInfo can
tell core how much RAM an OpBitmap of a given size would require.</p>

<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>The worst case of stack usage is most likely the callbacks from the
platform layer back into the Opera core code. One example is the
socket code: if sending all data completes immediately, the platform
may notify core code about this immediately, and core code may then
legally send more data right away. It is the platform implementation's
responsibility to limit the recursion depth in this case, and core's
responsibility to avoid deep recursions.</p>

<h3>Static memory usage</h3>

<p>The interfaces use none. Platform implementations may use some.</p>

<h3>Caching and freeing memory</h3>

<p>There are currently no means of requesting platform implementation
to reduce memory usage, other than deleting pi objects.</p>

<h3>Freeing memory on exit</h3>

<p>PiModule::Destroy() frees the memory. Platform code is responsible
for freeing any static memory allocated on their side.</p>

<h3>Temp buffers</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>Memory tuning</h3>

<p>No tuning.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

<p>No tests.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>Load and display a web page with text, images, plug-ins, borders
and scrollbars over HTTP. Print it.</p>

<h3>Design choices</h3>

<p>Since there is almost no code in this module, one can say that this
module deals more with memory information (<q>you're out of memory</q>, <q>to
store an image of that size I need to allocate this many bytes</q>) than
memory itself.</p>

<h3>Suggestions of improvements</h3>

<p>We should consider getting better control over the platform
implementation's memory usage. Classes that are likely to use a lot of
memory, are OpBitmap, OpFont and OpView.</p>
