<h1>Jaypeg module</h1>

$Id$

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>General description</h3>

Jaypeg is a jpeg decoder used in core-2 based versions of Opera and some 
core-1 based versions. It is intended as a replacement for libjpeg which was 
previously used.

<h3>Use-case: decode a jpeg from a web page or a skin</h3>

When Opera needs to decode a jpeg, either from a web page or a skin, Jaypeg is
invoked from the image module.

<h3>Design goals</h3>

The design goals of Jaypeg are:
<ul>
<li>Decode all jpegs supported by libjpeg</li>
<li>Keep the footprint small</li>
<li>Use little memory</li>
<li>Handle OOM</li>
<li>Allocate as small chunks of memory as possible</li>
<li>Make it easy to add jpeg 2000 support in the future</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supported standards</h3>

<h4>JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1</h4>
Jaypeg supports a subset of the jpeg specification. Supported parts are:
<ul>
<li>Huffman coding</li>
<li>Sequential DCT-based mode of operation</li>
<li>Progressive DCT-based mode of operation</li>
<li>8-bit sample precision</li>
</ul>
Unsupported parts are:
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic coding</li>
<li>Hierarchical mode of operation</li>
<li>Lossless mode of operation</li>
<li>12-bit sample precision (might be supported, it is untested until a file actually using it can be found)</li>
</ul>

<h4>JFIF</h4>
JPEG File Interchange Format 1.02 is supported.

<h4>Adobe</h4>
Adobes file interchange format is supported. Modes with alpha support are not supported.

<h4>EXIF</h4>
EXIF version 2.2 is supported. Support for it is optional.

<h3>Not yet supported standards</h3>

<h4>JPEG 2000</h4>
JPEG 2000 support is planned, but not yet started.


<h2>API documentation</h2>

The <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a> is generated by Doxygen.

<h2>Memory handling</h2>

<h3>OOM handling</h3>
OOM is signaled through OP_STATUS. TRAP/LEAVE is not used in this module. When
an OOM occurs the OP_STATUS will be propagated back to the entry point. It is 
assumed that the caller handles the OOM and does not try to call jaypeg again 
after an OOM has occured. OOM can also be signaled from the image listener.
That case is handled the same way as any other OOM.

<h3>Memory usage</h3>
<h4>Stack</h4>
Jaypeg contains no recursive functions. The only allocation except a few 
simple types is the IDCT which allocates an array of 64 ints on the stack.
<h4>Heap</h4>
One scanline in RGB format is always allocated. In the case of linear 
interpolation two scanlines are allocated.<br>
Tables for dequantization and huffman decoded are also always stored in memory.
The size of these is specified in the jpeg image. The upper bound is 4 arrays 
of 64 shorts each for dequantization and 4 arrays of up to 16*255 bytes for 
huffman decoding.<br>
For sequential jpegs, only one MCU row will be allocated. The size of an MCU 
row depends on the image being decoded. It is the maximum component resolution
multiplied by eight multiplied by the width of the image scaled up to an even 
multiplier of 8. The size also depends on how many components the jpeg 
contains (the most common is 3 components, Ycrcb).<br>
For progressive jpegs, one MCU row will be kept. In addition all blocks of DCT 
coefficients will be kept in memory. The amount required for this is the size
of the image multiplied by the number of components multiplied by 2. This is 
divided into one memory block per 8 lines and per component.
<h4>Static</h4>
Jaypeg contains a clamping table and two tables for color transforms. Total 
size of these tables is 1.5 kbytes. There is also 192 bytes of table data for 
IDCT.
<h4>Freeing</h4>
When the decoder is deleted all allocated memory will be freed. Memory can 
also be freed if a new image is decoded using the same decoder. There is no way
for force all memory to be freed without deleteing the decoder.

<h3>Future improvements</h3>
The memory allocations could, and should, be modified to always allocate 16k 
blocks.

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<h3>Main decoding loop</h3>
A jpeg is decoded by jaypeg through calling the decode loop repetedly until 
all data has been sent or the image has been completly decoded.<br>
When the decode loop is called, jaypeg will fill an internal buffer which is 
used to keep track of how much data needs to be resent the next time, and then 
call the apropriate internal decode (currently only standard jpeg, but jpeg 
2000 will probably be supported later on).

<h3>Jpeg decoding loop</h3>
The jpeg decoder will look for the next marker in the code stream. When such a 
marker is found it is parsed and the state changes are stored in the internal 
state.<br>
The maker causing the actual decoding is start of scan. When this is
encountered jaypeg will start decoding huffman tables and in the case of 
sequential jpegs perform an IDCT.<br>
In the case of progressive jpegs the coefficients are simply stored without 
being transformed. This is done to avoid transforming unused values. The 
precission might be increased before the image is actually drawn, and it that 
case it is a vaste of resources to perform the IDCT for these values.<br>
When a complete MCU row is decoded a sequential jpeg will send this to the 
image listener. A progressive jpeg does not do this for the reasons mentioned 
above.<br>
To send the image data to the image in the case of Progressive jpegs the 
flushProgressive method must be called.

<h3>IDCT</h3>
The IDCT algortihm used transforms the coefficients from DCT to fourier and the
performs an IDFT transform instead.

<h3>Writing image data</h3>
When the image data is copied to the image it is first interpolated to the 
correct resolution since if some of the components have lower resolution. 
This is usually done with a linear interpolation.<br>
When all components have the same resolution the samples are transformed into
the RGB colorspace and sent to the image listener.
