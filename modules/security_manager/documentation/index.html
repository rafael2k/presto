<h1>Security Manager</h1>

<p>$Id$</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The security manager serves as a locus for code that decides
whether permission should be granted for the execution of certain
actions in certain contexts.  (The canonical example is whether a
script located in document A should be allowed to manipulate or access
document B.)</p>

<p>At this time (Feb 2006) only a small number of security actions are
in this module, but the intention is that more should be located
here.</p>

<p>The module also documents the security models that are
implemented.</p>

<h2>Design principles</h2>

<h3>Separability of security models</h3>

<p>I want to try to separate the different security models to the
greatest possible extent, so that decisions made for one model do not
spill over to another model unless that is clearly intended.</p>

<p>Separability will make it possible to extract just the files needed
for a particular model and, assuming that the model is used in the
proper places, determine whether the model appears to be consistent
and correctly implemented.</p>

<p>Therefore, each model consists of five parts:</p>

<ul>

<li> A set of new command names in the enum
     <code>OpSecurityManager::Operation</code>.

<li> A new base class for <code>OpSecurityManager</code>, defining the
     security checker methods and any auxiliary code for the new
     commands.

<li> A case in <code>OpSecurityManager::CheckSecurity()</code> for
     each new command name, dispatching to methods defined in the
     new base class for <code>OpSecurityManager</code>.

<li> A new base class for <code>OpSecurityContext</code>, defining any
     additional fields the model needs in its context data structure.

<li> A file in the <code>documentation</code> directory describing the
     model, and a link from this file to that file in the list of models
     above.

</ul>

<p>In addition, new utility methods may be defined in
<code>OpSecurityManager</code>, and code in the various models may be
changed to merge common utility functions.  But complex policy should
not be encoded in the utility functions.</p>

<p>The new base classes are defined in a new header file; the
implementations are defined in new source files.  Thus "extraction" of
a policy is physical: the files defining and implementing the policy
are separate from the framework.</p>
