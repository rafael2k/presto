<h1>Security Manager Module Memory Documentation</h1>

<h2>Used OOM policies</h2>
<p>
All security manager interfaces return OOM errors through OP_STATUS
return values.
</p>

<h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>
<p>
Clients of the security manager interfaces are expected to handle or
propagate the error.
</p>

<h2>Description of flow</h2>
<p>
Basically called from dom, gadgets and dochand modules to check
security aspects like origin checks.
</p>

<h2>Heap memory usage</h2>
<p>
OpSecurityManager singleton is created on startup by the module
object.
</p>
<p>
OpSecurityUtilities::InitializeTables() is using heap memory to store
tables over know intranet addresses. These tables are generated
on-demand, currently only in CheckGadgetSecurity().
</p>
<p>
The rest of the heap allocations are done for storing gadget policies
parsed from xml.
</p>

<h2>Stack memory usage</h2>
<p>
Very little. No known recursions.
</p>

<h2>Caching and freeing memory</h2>
<p>
Intranet ranges table (OpSecurityUtilities::InitializeTables()) is
created on demand and not freed until exit. The size of the table is
very small.
</p>

<h2>Freeing memory on exit</h2>
<p>
All heap memory is pointed to via the OpSecurityManager singleton in
the module object and is freed by the module object on exit.
</p>

<h2>Temp buffers</h2>

<h3>Current use of MemoryManager temporary buffers</h3>
<p>
Not used at all in this module.
</p>

<h2>Memory tuning</h2>
<p>
No tuning possible.
</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>
None.
</p>

<h2>Coverage</h2>
<p>
Run widgets with various policies and javascript running cross domain
scripts.
</p>
<p>
The module selftest covers a lot of the code, but you need to force
OOM in order to test the OOM behaviour.
</p>

<h2>Design choices</h2>
<p>
None of interest.
</p>

<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<p>
GadgetUrlFilter::UrlFieldAsString uses a TempBuffer object whose
storage is not ever freed until Opera exits. In edge cases of very
long URLs or parts of URLs, it will take up a certain amount of heap
which is not made available for the rest of the time Opera
exists. This buffer should probably be freed for strings above a
certain length.
