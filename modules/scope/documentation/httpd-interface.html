<h1>HTTPD interface to the proxy</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The proxy provides an HTTP interface.  Clients written in HTML+JS
running inside web browsers use XMLHttpRequest to interact with Opera
via the debugging proxy.

<p> The main points:
<ul>
<li><p> The proxy listens for HTTP requests on port 8002 by default.

<li><p> Requests to the proxy encode the desired operation in the path
part of the GET or POST request.  For example, a GET of "/services"
retrieves a list of configured services, a GET of "/ecmascript-logger"
retrieves the next available script logger datum, and a POST to
"/ecmascript-logger" can send commands to that service.

<li><p> If no data are available to return to the client when the
request comes in, the proxy will keep the client waiting for some
short time (20 seconds; experimental) before sending a timeout
response, prompting the client to try again.

<li> <p> All data transmitted in a POST, and all data returned by
either GET or POST, are on XML format.

<li> <p> A client library in "http-clients/clientlib.js" encapsulates
much of the common functionality described below, like getting and
enabling specific services and handling retries in the face of
timeouts.

</ul>

See the documentation in the client library for more information.  The
directory "http-clients/" also contains example clients, see eg
"script-logger.html".

<h2> Practical issues of using HTML+JS tools </h2>

<h3> Security restrictions </h3>

<p> Because the tool clients are regular HTML+JS pages the normal
security restrictions on XMLHttpRequest apply: XMLHttpRequest can only
access the host and port from which the containing page was loaded.
We work around this by loading the source for the tool client not from
a file: URL but via the web server in the proxy.  This is a hack, but
it's adequate.

<p> When the proxy is started it accepts a command line argument that
names the directory from which to load tools.  By default this is
"../http-clients", so if you start the proxy from the "proxy/"
directory in the source tree it will find the example tools.  For your
own use you can set things up differently, obviously.

<p> Requests to the web server starting with the string "/file/" are
served from the proxy's file directory.

<p> All files served by the web server in the proxy are marked
"no-cache", so it's pretty straightforward to experiment with tool
ideas.

<p> PLEASE NOTE that the way the client library interacts with the web
server usually prevents simply reloading the web page containing the
tool client.  Instead you must close the tab and open a new tab with
the tool client URL to reload the client.  No doubt this can (and
should) be fixed somehow.


<h3> Issues with stateless service </h3>

<p> The HTTP service is stateless and at this time the proxy has no
support for cookies or session identifiers.  There are some
consequences of this.

<h4> Single client </h4>

<p> There can only be a single client for a particular service through
the HTTP interface.  The proxy keeps an internal queue of data to be
sent to HTTP clients for a service, and the first client to ask for a
datum will get it.  Thus any particular client will only see some of
the data if multiple clients access the same service on the proxy.

<p> Any "enable" message for a service will clear any backlog of
messages for that service, because it is assuming that the client has
restarted.

<h4> Auto-disabling of service </h4>

<p> Since the HTTP protocol is stateless, a client that just
disappears can't be detected (eg by a socket closing).  The proxy will
prevent a backlog of data by limiting the queue of unconsumed data in
the proxy to some reasonable size (maybe 1000 items).


<h2>General responses</h2>

<h3>Response codes</h3>

<p> As a general rule the server returns "200 - OK", along with
appropriate data.

<p> Requests return <tt>&lt;ok/></tt> if they have no other data to
provide.

<p> Requests return <tt>&lt;error/></tt> on various kinds of error;
sometimes that element may have a payload that details the error.

<p> If Opera shuts down, any GET or POST request to an open service
will result in a <tt>&lt;quit/></tt> message.  When that message has
been sent the service will be disabled and has to be re-enabled when
Opera has restarted.


<h2>Configuring a service</h2>

<p> The client first reads the /services resource to obtain the list of
available services:
<pre>
   GET /services
</pre>
<p> The response is an XML structure on the format:
<pre>
   &lt;services>
     &lt;service name="<em>service-name</em>" />
     ...
   &lt;/services>
</pre>

<p> If the desired service is available, the client enables it by
accessing the service name in the /enable "directory", e.g.
<pre>
   GET /enable/http-logger
</pre>
<p> The response is <tt>&lt;error/></tt> if the service does not
exist, otherwise <tt>&lt;ok/></tt>.


<h2>Reading data</h2>

<p> Data are read by posting simple GET requests with the name of the service
as the path argument:
<pre>
   GET /http-logger
</pre>
<p> The response is normally the standard XML structure for the service.

<p> If the service for some reason is not available, or can't deliver
data in the timeout period, a <tt>&lt;timeout/></tt> response is delivered
instead.  The client should normally consider retrying the request.

<p> Any response code other than 200 means the request failed.


<h2>Writing data</h2>

<p> Data are written by POST requests; the posted data must have XML
format.  The data should <em>not</em> have a "&lt;?xml ... >" header, 
as this header is added by the proxy if necessary.
<pre>
   POST /ecmascript-logger

   &lt;set-parameters reformat="yes" />
</pre>
<p> The response is always immediate and is either <tt>&lt;ok/></tt> or
<tt>&lt;error/></tt>.  A separate GET must be used to read returned data.


<h2>Reading files</h2>

<p> Files can be read from the server by accessing them under the
virtual "/file" service:

<pre>
    GET /file/script-logger.html
</pre>

<p> Note this does not imply that the files should actually be located
in a directory called "/file", this is just syntax to trigger special
behavior in the web server.
