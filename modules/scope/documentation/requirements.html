        Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        The primary requirements for the tools architecture are these:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must allow for a multitude of tools, notably both tools for external users and tools we only use ourselves</li>
        <li>Must be easily portable: tools should be product and UI independent when that is reasonable</li>
        <li>Must work with Opera on devices</li>
        <li>Must be able to take advantage of Opera on the desktop when appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        (In addition there are probably numerous secondary requirements.)</p>
