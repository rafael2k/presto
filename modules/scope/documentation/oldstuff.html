<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Multiple external debuggers</h3>

<p>The <code>scope</code> module provides facilities for interaction
with external or semi-external content debuggers.  Examples are
javascript debuggers, document inspectors, logging services, and
playback services.</p>

<p>...</p>


<h3>Debugger architecture</h3>

<p>A module that wishes to provide debugging services will implement
this service in two parts, a "back end" close to the module code (and
usually located with the module in the CVS) and a "front end" that
serializes and deserializes data and communicates with the debugger
(usually located in the <code>scope</code> module).  The back end and
front end will normally communicate by a simple API using data
structures defined in the back end.  Thus the <code>scope</code>
module contains code pertaining to the debugging needs of many
modules.</p>

<p>The two-layer architecture for the debugging support makes it
simple to implement custom or multiple communication protocols or to
move parts of the debugger into Opera for performance or other
reasons.</p>

<p>For debuggers that are in fact external to Opera, there is a third
transport layer below the front end that is responsible for sending
and receiving data over a network connection.</p>


<h3>Typical control flow</h3>

<p>The back end is structured in part as an event listener.  An event
in the debugged module will be signalled as a call to the back end.
It will extract the necessary data pertaining to the event from the
module state, package these data somehow, and call the front end to
have them delivered to the debugger.  For an external debugger, the
front end transforms the data to XML and delivers them to the network
layer for delivery.  The network layer returns to the front end, which
returns to the back end, which can either block (when it has just
sent an event that the debugger wants it to stop at) or just continue.</p>

<p>If there is a debugger that wants to control Opera in some way,
then the transport layer will receive data from the debugger.  It
delivers these data to the front end, which deserializes them into
data structures understood by the back end and finally delivers them
to the back end.  The back end then implements the necessary
operations on its module.</p>


<h2>External representation</h2>

<h3>XML</h3>

<p>The preferred representation for messages to and from external
debugging agents is ASCII-encoded XML, and the scope module provides
numerous utilities to ease the use of this representation.</p>

<p>Though an XML representation will typically be larger and slower
than a well-designed binary representation, it is human-readable and
therefore more easily debuggable.  XML libraries exist for many
programming languages and therefore places few restrictions on the
technology chosen for a particular debugger.</p>

<p>The following style guidelines apply to all the XML protocols.</h2>

<ul>
<li>  Tag and attribute names are biCapitalized with initial lower case

<li>  ASCII data of bounded length can be placed in attributes, but all
      non-ASCII data or data of unbounded length must be shipped as text
      content

<li>  Optional or variable content is always represented as subelements
</ul>

<h3>Encoding</h3>

<p>Attribute values never contain characters outside ASCII.  They are
escaped if necessary, using the normal "%xx" scheme.</p>

<p>Element text data can contain characters from the entire Unicode
character set.  These data are always base-64 encoded.</p>

<p>Following the preceding two translations, the message is
representable in ASCII and therefore also UTF-8.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The file <a href="js-protocol.txt">js-protocol.txt</a> contains the
protocol specification for the Javascript debugger.</p>


<h2>Implementation matters</h2>

<h3>XML serialization</h3>

<p>This is currently done by ad-hoc methods in a utility class,
"ScopeDebugMessage".  For the moment this seems to be adequate.</p>

<h3>XML deserialization</h3>

<p>This is done by a wrapper class around the XML parser,
"XMLFragmentParser".  This wrapper class also functions as an
interator over the generated parse tree, allowing the conversion from
XML to an internal data structure to be implemented by ad-hoc code.
This too seems to be adequate.</p>

<h3>Transport layer</h3>

<p>Previously the Javascript debugger used custom code for transport.</p>

<p>For the scope module, I am planning to instead use the probetools
"shell" functionality as the transport layer, since it was designed to
provide this type of service anyway.</p>
