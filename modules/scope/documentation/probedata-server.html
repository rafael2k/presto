    <h1>
        Probedata server</h1>
    <p>
        $Id$</p>
    <h2>
        Overall idea</h2>
    <p>
        The probedata server provides interactive online access to the data structures in the probetools infrastructure, if that
        is enabled. This allows online and offline profiling tools to be written.</p>
    <p>
        Ideas for these tools include task-manager like profiling, where the tool shows where the application has spent the last
        <em>n</em> seconds, cumulative profiling, and an interactive interface to control probetools (e.g., to clear its profiling
        data before an experiment).</p>
    <h2>
        Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        No requirements are available yet.</p>
    <h2>
        Protocol</h2>
    <p>
        The current protocol is a two-way XML-based synchronous protocol.</p>
    <p>
        The service name of the probedata server is <tt>probedata-server</tt>.</p>
    <h3>
        Command: <tt>all-data</tt></h3>
    <p>
        The <tt>all-data</tt> command retrieves the current profiling data in full exactly as it would be written to the file <tt>opprof0.out</tt>.</p>
    <pre>
    &lt;all-data/>
</pre>
    <p>
        The response to the <tt>all-data</tt> command is a single data element containing encoded binary data. As usual this is
        presented in the format of a UTF-16 Unicode string:</p>
    <pre>
    &lt;data contents="all-data">
      &lt;base64-encoded-data>xxxx...&lt;/base64-encoded-data>
    &lt;/data>
</pre>
    <p>
        Here, <tt>xxxx...</tt> is the string representation of a base64-coding of a byte array.</p>
    <h3>
        Other commands
    </h3>
    <p>
        There will be other commands soon, as this is just preliminary work. These may be commands like <tt>profiling-data</tt>
        (to obtain just time profile), <tt>profiling-snapshot</tt> (to obtain time profile differences since last snapshot), and
        <tt>memory-snapshot</tt> (to obtain a representation of the heap).</p>
    <h3>
        General failures
    </h3>
    <p>
        If a command fails it will respond with a <tt>failure</tt> element:</p>
    <pre>
    &lt;failure reason="<em>text</em>">
       <em>command</em>
    &lt;/failure>
</pre>
    <p>
        where <em>text</em> is some human-readable explanation of the failure and <em>command</em> is the entire command that failed,
        as received.</p>
    <p>
        Invalid XML may fail silently. (Should probably fix this.)</p>
