<h1>Module documentation for <code>scope</code></h1>

<p>$Id$

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The <code>scope</code> module provides an infrastructure for
building a multitude of debugging tools, some for internal use at
Opera and some to be shipped with Opera as "developer tools".

<p> The most famous user of scope is <a href="http://kaleidoscope.vlab.osa/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/var/hg/dragonfly">dragonfly</a>,
but other tools are also available from <a href="http://kaleidoscope.vlab.osa/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/var/hg/">kaleidoscope</a>.
At present these are opwatir (Opera's implementation of
<a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">watir</a>) and pyscope (a python
client for scope mainly used by scope developers).

<p> The tools can live partly inside Opera, partly outside -- and the
exact division depends mostly on the needs of the tool.  Read <a
href="requirements.html">the requirements</a> and <a
href="architecture.html">the architecture</a> for more information.

<h2>Documents that need to be written</h2>

<p>(None at present.)

<h2>Tool ideas</h2>

<p> All tools described above have at least been partially implemented
at this time.  This section contains some ideas for other tools.

<h3>For site developers (and internal use)</h3>

<dl>
<dt> <a href="dom-inspector.html">DOM inspector</a>
<dd> <p> Part of the projected developer tools suite.
</dl>


<h3>Mostly for developers and QA; may be useful for others</h3>

<dl>
<dt> Command interface
<dd> <p> A "command interface" to Opera generalizes some of the other
     tools, allowing commands to be sent to Opera and results to be
     retrieved.  Commands may be things like opening and closing
     windows and loading URLs into them, running selftest, uploading
     and downloading content (consider asking for opera:cache from a
     tool).  This is related to what the current probetools shell
     infrastructure does.

<dt> Benchmark runner
<dd> <p> A benchmark runner allows content to be uploaded, run in a 
     controlled environment, and results reported; there may eg be
     JS callbacks for reporting results measured by JS, and ways
     of obtaining statistics gathered during the run.

     <p> There can be benchmarks built into Opera, like selftests are,
     and they can perhaps be run through this infrastructure.

<dt> Selftest runner
<dd> <p> Runs some selection of the built-in selftests.  Useful for
     automated regression testing, probably.

<dt> Cache monitor (Tahera / Sigbjørn)
<dd> <p> This tool sends logging data about cache activity: what goes
     into the cache, what is removed from the cache, what is replaced.  
     Information would be at least: URL, age, expiry information, 
     cache-related HTTP headers plus a timestamp.

<dt> Memory monitor
<dd> <p> This tool interacts with probetools / memtools to extract and
     display memory profiling information, on-line and off-line.  Most
     likely this will partly be a port of the memory displays from
     happy-malloc, the core-gogi memory logging, and the Synergy "Gem"
     infrastructure.

<dt> General resource logging framework
<dd> <p>This generalizes other tools, allowing parts of Opera easily to register
     with the framework when they want to log resource "movement".  See
     the cache monitor for one example; another use case is platform independent
     logging of open sockets / files, and platform dependent logging of
     eg graphics resources.  

     <p>We would control this as we control the DBG functionality, through
     a config file that enables specific resource names to be tracked,
     and the interface could be DBG-like macros.

     <p> Pettern references <code>adjunct\m2\src\backend\p2p\bt-util.h</code>,
     and suggests resource type, address, source file and line number as
     reasonable parameters (or to be extracted automatically).

<dt> Plugin monitor
<dd> <p> This tool logs all calls into and out of plugins running inside
     Opera, and perhaps also allows breakpoints to be set on these
     calls, so that they may be debugged interactively.

<dt> TCP/IP logger (Sigbjørn)
<dd> <p> We'd be restricted to inspecing Opera's TCP connections (and
     support code might have to be written for each socket
     implementation).  Utility: unknown, certainly nonzero.

<dt> Page contents tracker (Sigbjørn)
<dd> <p> Have some way of extracting from Opera every item linked from a
     document: images, scripts, css, plugin content, etc.

<dt> Page extractor (Sigbjørn)
<dd> <p> External interface to Opera to extract an entire page with all the
     context needed to load it in some other context without accessing the
     net.  Probably impossible in practice, but one can probably get close.

     <p> Ties in as much with the "director" idea as anything -- mostly the
     problem here is to implement the functionality in Opera, not to write
     the tool itself.

<dt> Director
<dd> <p> This is a tool that runs on the same machine as the host and
     is responsible for starting Opera and detecting when it crashes.
     Parameters can be passed to the director and used when Opera is
     started, esp things like memory size and window size.

     <p>(No doubt QA has tools like this already.)
</dl>


<h3>For developers only</h3>

<dl>
<dt> "DEBUG" logger
<dd> <p> Captures the output from Opera's internal debug
     infrastructure, normally enabled only in debug builds.  Probably
     quite useful for developers on embedded systems.

<dt> Message profiler and logger
<dd> <p> Captures messages in Opera's message queue, keeps running
     profile of how much time is spent per message (mean/median/range),
     displays message queue when asked.
</dl>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<dl>
<dt> kibitz (eddy)
<dd> <p>The basic idea of kibitz is to let clients be able to see what a user
is doing in a tab; simplistically, a tab is created in the client's
instance of Opera which mimics the behaviour of a tab in the host's
instance of opera, except that it's view-only - trying to interact
with it directly has no effect, though you can move it around if it's
not maximised, or put other tabs in front of it; zoom in/out would
scale the whole tab up/down.  Ideally, the host user gets to pick
which tabs are thus exposed, but it would probably suffice to expose
the active tab - with slightly weird effects for the clients when the
user switches tabs.
 
<p>Use cases:
<ul>
<li> Remotely talk someone (e.g. over the phone) through how to interact
     with some web application, form or whatever, e.g. (Opera-specific)
     user talking QA through the steps to reproduce a bug, or QA doing
     the same for the developer (possibly at a different office) working
     on the bug.
<li> Web-site usability testing; developer gets to see how users really
     interact with pages, without the developer looming over them while
     they do it (they know the developer's "watching", but without the
     psychological impact of someone physically looking over their
     shoulder).
<li> Two-way kibitz, each kibitzing the active tab in the other's
     browser, has potential for game designers ...
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em>: There has been talk about implementing the same
     application using Alien (a.k.a. webserver). That might be a better
	 platform, but in any case: Make sure no one else is implementing
	 this concurrently!
