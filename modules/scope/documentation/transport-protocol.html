<h1>Transport protocol</h1>

<p>This document defines the protocols by which Opera and debugging
clients communicate via the debugging proxy using TCP/IP connections.</p>

<p>Version: 1.0 draft 1, 2006-07-04</p>

<h2>Agents and channels</h2>

<p>The communicating agents are "Opera", the "proxy", and the various
debugging "clients". In addition, there are debugging "services"
inside Opera on whose behalf Opera manages the communication. (See <a
href="architecture.html">the architecture document</a> for an overall
description of the structure of the system.)</p>

<p>Opera and the clients connect to the proxy via bidirectional
TCP/IP channels in arbitrary order at arbitrary times.</p>

<p>Only one Opera instance can be connected to the proxy at any one
time. An arbitrary number of clients can be connected simultaneously.</p>

<p>Any agent can close any channel at any time without prior notice.
When a channel is closed by the agent at one end, the agent at the
other end should interpret this in exactly the same way as receiving a
<code>*quit</code> message (see below).</p>

<p>Any received <code>*quit</code> message on a channel should be
interpreted to mean that the channel on which it was received is
closing, and the agent that sent the <code>*quit</code> should
subsequently close its end of the channel.</p>


<h2>General message format</h2>

<p>All data communicated is Unicode character data encoded as UTF-16
in big-endian (network) byte order.</p>

<p>A message is comprised of a character count, a keyword, and 
arbitrary data:</p>
<pre>
    count keyword data
</pre>

<p>The count and keyword are followed by exactly one ASCII blank
(0x0020). Note carefully that the blank is a terminator, not a
separator.</p>

<p>The count is comprised of a sequence of characters in the ASCII
numerals range (0x0030 through 0x0039) and represents a base-10 number
that gives the length of the message, not counting the characters of
the count field or the count field's terminating blank character.
Leading zeroes are prohibited.  The length of the count is at most 10
characters, and its value is at most 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>

<p>Keywords are either reserved words, which all start with an ASCII
asterisk character (0x002A), or names of debugging services.  Keywords
may not contain the ASCII comma character (0x002C) but are otherwise
unrestricted.</p>

<h2>Message flow overview</h2>

<p>This schema provides an overall view of message flow between the 
agents. More information is given in the following description of the messages.</p>

<pre>
            Opera              proxy                 client

*services     ---------------->
                                    ----------------->   *services
                                    <-----------------   *enable
*enable       <----------------
data          <--------------------------------------->  data
                                ....
                                    <------------------  *quit
*disable      <----------------
*quit         ---------------->
                                    ------------------>  *hostquit
                                    ------------------>  *quit
</pre>

<h2>Control messages: Opera/proxy protocol</h2>

<p>(The character count prefix is omitted in the following description.)</p>

<h3>To proxy: <code>*services</code> message</h3>

<p>When Opera makes a successful connection to the proxy it sends a single
message:</p>
<pre>
    *services &lt;service-names&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here &lt;service-names&gt; is a comma-separated list (with no
embedded blanks) of names of services provided by the debuggers built
into Opera.</p>

<p>For example, if Opera is configured with the HTTP logger
and the URL player, it would send:</p>
<pre>
    *services http-logger,url-player
</pre>


<h3>To Opera: <code>*enable</code> message</h3>

<p>When the proxy wants to activate a debugging service in Opera
(which happens when the first client asks for the service) it sends
one message per service:</p>
<pre>
    *enable &lt;service-name&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here &lt;service-name&gt; is the name of the service to enable.  For
example, to enable the HTTP logger it sends this:</p>
<pre>
    *enable http-logger
</pre>


<h3>To Opera: <code>*disable</code> message</h3>

<p>When the proxy wants to deactivate a debugging service in Opera
(which happens when the last client using the service has quit) it
sends one message per service:</p>
<pre>
    *disable &lt;service-name&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here &lt;service-name&gt; is the name of the service to disable. For
example, to disable the HTTP logger it sends this:</p>
<pre>
    *disable http-logger
</pre>


<h3>To either: <code>*quit</code> message</h3>

<p>The <code>*quit</code> message is sent to Opera when the proxy
terminates operation. No communication with the proxy will be
possible once it has sent the <code>*quit</code> message.  When Opera
receives this message it should disable all debugging services that
are currently enabled.</p>

<p>The <code>*quit</code> message is also sent by Opera to the proxy
when Opera terminates operation.  No communication with Opera is
possible once Opera has sent the <code>*quit</code> message.  When the
proxy receives this message it broadcasts <code>*hostquit</code> to all of its clients.</p>

<p>The message consists simply of the keyword:</p>
<pre>
    *quit
</pre>


<h2>Control messages: Client/proxy protocol</h2>

<p>(The character count prefix is omitted in the following description.)</p>

<h3>To client: <code>*services</code> message</h3>

<p>When the client connects to the proxy it does not send anything,
but waits for a <code>*services</code> message from the proxy.</p>  

<p>The format of the message is as for the Opera/proxy case.</p>


<h3>To proxy: <code>*enable</code> message</h3>

<p>Once the client has received the list of services and has
determined that the services it needs to interact with is on the list,
it sends an <code>*enable</code> message to the proxy to enable all 
the services it needs:</p>
<pre>
    *enable &lt;service-names&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here &lt;service-names&gt; is a comma-separated list of service
names.</p>

<p>This message has a secondary effect: it causes the proxy to
forward all data messages bearing that service name to the client.</p>

<p>For example, if the client wishes to enable the console logger and
the JavaScript debugger, and receive data traffic for those services,
it would send:</p>
<pre>
    *enable console-logger,javascript-debugger
</pre>

<h3>To either: <code>*quit</code> message</h3>

<p>The <code>*quit</code> message is sent from the proxy to a client
to signify that the proxy is about to terminate, and
that the client should disconnect from the proxy.</p>

<p>The <code>*quit</code> message is also sent from the client to the
proxy to signify that the client is terminating.  The proxy will then
send <code>*disable</code> messages to Opera for all services for
which the quitting client was the last active client.</p>

<p>The format of the message is the same as for the Opera/proxy case.</p>

<h3>To client: <code>*hostquit</code> message</h3>

<p>The <code>*hostquit</code> message is sent from the proxy to a client
to signify that Opera is about to terminate.</p>

<p>The client may keep the connection to the proxy, waiting for a new
<code>*services</code> message when a new Opera instance connects.</p>

<p>The format of the message is the same as for the Opera/proxy case.</p>

<h2>Data messages</h2>

<p> Data messages carry traffic between a debugging client and a
debugging service inside Opera, and can be sent by either side. They
take the form of a service name followed by arbitrary data:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;service-name&gt; &lt;data&gt;
</pre>

<p>For example, the HTTP logger service might send messages that look 
like this:</p>
<pre>
    http-logger 0x00371548 3 HTTP/1.0 ...
</pre>

<p>The proxy performs routing of messages from Opera to the clients:
any client having asked to enable the service whose name appears in a
message from Opera, will receive that message.</p>


<h2>Issues / thoughts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sending everything as UTF-16 is a simplifying decision, but it 
     wastes some bandwidth.</li>  

<li>Data messages could be tagged with multiple comma-separated
     service names, but is there any benefit to this?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>The blank should be a separator, not a terminator: the mandatory
     keyword ensures there will be a blank to terminate the count, and
     the count provides information about when to stop reading the
     keyword.</li>

<li>There's really no good reason that <code>*enable</code> and
     <code>*disable</code> sent to Opera can't take multiple service
     names, and so be consistent with the message sent from the client
     to the proxy.</li>
</ul>
