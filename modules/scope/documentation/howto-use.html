<h1>How to use the tools (quick introduction)</h1>

<p>$Id$

<p> We'll use the console logger as the example application, because
it's simplest.

<h2>Compiling Opera (core-2-gogi)</h2>

<p> You need to have the scope module in your module set (don't forget
modules/readme.txt).

<p> Enable FEATURE_SCOPE and all the scope features you want, for this
example you want at least FEATURE_SCOPE_CONSOLE_LOGGER.

<p> Recompile Opera.

<h2>Compiling the Java proxy and tool clients</h2>

<p> You can find the precompiled tools in CVS in module scope under
<a href="https://cvs-doc.oslo.opera.com/cvs/browse.xml?dir=dist&module=scope">dist</a>.
If they work for you, read no further here.

<p> <b>Tools:</b> Currently the development environment is Netbeans&nbsp;5.0.  
(Older versions won't do.)  If you don't have it, get it from <a
href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php">http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/</a>.
Install it.

<p> <b> Open projects:</b> You need to open two projects in Netbeans.
From "File | Open Project ..." open the following projects in the
scope module:
<ul>
<li> clients/console-logger
<li> proxy
</ul>

<p> While opening these you'll probably be asked whether to open the
dependent projects clients/clientlib and clients/httpd.  Answer "yes".
(Otherwise open them manually.)

<p> <b> Compile the proxy:</b> In the projects pane, right-click
"proxy" and select "Build project".  This creates
modules/scope/proxy/dist/proxy.jar.

<p> <b> Compile the console-logger:</b> In the projects pane,
right-click "console-logger" and select "Build project".  This creates
both the clientlib jar file and the console-logger jar file.
<em>Note:</em> The output pane in Netbeans will contain the command
line you will use to run the logger.

<h2>Running everything</h2>

<p> Your opera.ini file contains information about where Opera will
find the proxy.  In the section "[Developer&nbsp;Tools]" you can set
the variable "Proxy&nbsp;Host" to the dotted IP address of the proxy
host (the default is localhost, 127.0.0.1) and the variable
"Proxy&nbsp;Port" to the port number (the default is 7001). E.g.
the <code>opera.ini</code> file should contain something like:
<pre>
[Developer Tools]
Proxy Host=127.0.0.1
Proxy Port=7001
Proxy Auto Connect=1
</pre>

<p> The option "Proxy&nbsp;Auto&nbsp;Connect" will enable automatically
connecting to the proxy on startup. Because of security risks, this will
only happen if the host is localhost. To connect manually, go to the
URL <a href="opera:debug">opera:debug</a> and click "Connect". This
also works for remote hosts.

<p> Script debugging needs to be compiled in if you want to perform
Ecmascript debugging or DOM/CSS-inspection.

<p> You need to create two shell windows.

<p> The proxy must be started first, so cd to modules/scope/proxy in
one shell and type "java -jar dist/proxy.jar" to start the proxy.

<p> In another shell, cd to modules/scope/client/console-logger and
paste in the command line Netbeans gave you.

<p> Finally start Opera.  You should see a little logging output in
the proxy window, and once you go to a page in Opera that generates
console messages, you should see them appear in the console window.

<p> You can now quit Opera or the console logger; the proxy stays up
until you kill it and can be reused (though it sometimes becomes
wedged and needs to be restarted).


<h2>The debug module</h2>

<p> The debug module will log debug messages to the console, and
therefore to the logger, if you enable it.  In your Opera directory
create a file called debug.txt with the following contents:
<pre>
  debugging=on
  console=on
  *
</pre>
<p> (The key "*" says to log all debug messages; replace this with
selected debugging keywords if you like.  Try "gogifont".)


<h2>Other information</h2>

<p> For the HTTP logger and URL player you also need the following projects:
<ul>
<li> clients/http-logger 
<li> clients/urlplayer
</ul>
<p> They're compiled like the console logger was compiled.
