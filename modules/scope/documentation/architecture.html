<h1>Debugging infrastructure architecture</h1>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>An architecture that meets <a href="requirements.html">the requirements</a> is as follows:</p>
<pre>
     +--------------------+            tcp/ip,       +-----------+
     |                    |            shmem, +------| Front-end |
     |                  +---+          ...    |      +-----------+
     | +----------+     | N |                 v
     | | Back-end |---->| U |              +-----+
     | +----------+     | B |              |     |
     |                  |   |------------->|<b>Proxy</b>|
     | +----------+     |   |   tcp/ip,    |     |
     | | Back-end |---->|   |   shmem,     +-----+
     | +----------+     |   |   ...           ^
     |                  +---+                 |      +-----------+
     |                    |                   +------| Front-end |
     +--------------------+                          +-----------+

           <b>Opera</b>                                    <b>Debugging clients</b>
</pre>

<p>The important points of this design are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools are split into back ends which reside in Opera, and
    front ends which reside elsewhere.</li>

<li>Inside Opera, the tool back ends register themselves with a tools
    manager ("NUB") that resides in the scope module, and communicate
    through that manager.</li>

<li>Outside Opera, front ends handle the user interface, control, and
    other aspects that can be moved out of Opera proper.</li>

<li>Opera and the tool manager both connect to a single proxy which
    acts as a hub in the system, and manages communication and data
    distribution.</li>

<li>Multiple front ends can communicate with multiple back ends.  For
    example,
  <ul>
    <li>the memory logger front end can interact with both the
    malloc back end (for allocation summaries) and the ecmascript
    back end (for garbage collection events);</li>
    <li>while the ecmascript
    debugger front end can communicate both with its own back end and
    with the DOM inspector's back end.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>The communication channels can be anything from a network to
    shared memory, depending on the platform's abilities and how
    much bandwidth a tool needs.</li>

<li>With just a small amount of abstraction the proxy will become
    invisible to both back ends and front ends, so particularly
    data-intensive tools can move into Opera, be part of the Opera UI,
    and still use the same framework.</li>

<li>How functionality is split between a front end and a back end
    depends on the tool; it is not something that is restricted to a
    great extent by this architecture.</li>

<li>Since communication can be via a network connection, front ends
    can be written in whatever language the tool author chooses.</li>

<li>Since Opera connects to the proxy over a single connection, even 
    embedded versions of Opera (eg on phones) can be debugged because
    there is no need for the tool to be able to connect to the phone
    directly.</li>
</ul>
