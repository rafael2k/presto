    <h1>Introduction to Selftest</h1>

    <p>
      Selftest is a great tool for writing automated regression tests. It is
      rather young (development started June 2002, and it has not been used very
      much during its first year). Writing automated regression tests is a good
      thing. The advantages are:
      <ul>
        <li>When code change, we will be able to catch a lot of regression bugs
          just by running the tests, and make sure that they pass.
        <li>By using tests while writing new code, you will be confident that
          your code is correct.
        <li>Tests will define functionality. Code is promising to support
          everything that is tested, nothing more, nothing less.
        <li>All tests are checked in, and they use the same format. That way, no
          tests will be lost.
      </ul>
    <p>
      The Selftest tool has a number of nice features that make it suitable for
      automated regression tests, specially in combination with Opera.
      <ul>
        <li>It is easy to write tests, and you can write them quickly.
        <li>Selftest supports asynchronous tests.
        <li>Selftest supports ecmascript tests.
        <li>Selftest supports manual regression testing.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Writing automated regression tests for your code is mandatory. It is part
      of the process for writing reliable code.
    <p>
      The Selftest engine is implemented in a language
      called <a href="http://pike.ida.liu.se">Pike</a>. Normally, you will not
      notice that more than you need to install Pike. The Selftest engine itself
      is like a black box that will take care of all the details associated with
      testcode generation.

      <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install Pike. See the installation guidelines in
          the <a href='manual.html#using'>manual</a> for how to install Pike on
          Windows and Linux.
        <li>Enable Selftest, FEATURE_SELFTEST should be set to YES. How this is
          done varies from platform to platform, see
          the <a href="manual.html">manual</a> for more details.
        <li>Compile the Opera project.
      </ul>

      <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>
      Remember when you first learned C, and you saw the first simple
      application printing the string Hello World. Since then, a lot of
      languages and toolkits have provided a basic example, demonstrating what
      you can do, and called it Hello world.
    <p>
      Here we have a Hello world test for Selftest. Create a file called
      tutorial.ot. Then, add this content:

      <pre>
 // tutorial1.ot
 group "tutorial 1";

 test("Hello world")
 {
     int i = 1;
     int j = 1;
     verify(i == j);
 }
      </pre>
    <p>
      <code>group</code> is the first keyword in this file. All tests and other
      content below the group definition, until next group definition or the end
      of the file, will belong to the group. <em>"tutorial_1"</em> is the name
      of the group.
    <p>
      The next keyword that we need to know is <code>test</code>. It is used to
      define a test.

      This test is called "Hello world". The body of the test consists of
      regular C++ code, with the addition of a special
      command <code>verify</code>.
    <p>
      <code>verify</code> will make sure that the expression given as a
      parameter evaluates to <strong>true</strong>. If it doesn't, the test will
      fail. In this case, <code>verify</code> will verify that 1 equals 1, and
      the <em>"Hello world"</em> test will pass, unless the compiler is buggy.
    <p>
      Next is a test that will fail.
      <pre>
 // tutorial2.ot
 group "tutorial 2";

 test("Fail Hello world")
 {
     int i = 1;
     int j = 2;
     verify(i == j);
 }
      </pre>
    <p>
      The test <em>"Fail Hello world"</em> will fail, since 1 is not equal to 2.

      <h2>Running the tests</h2>
    <p>
      Now we have written two tests, but how do we run them?

    <p>When we compile Opera, the Selftest engine will search for all *.ot-files
      in the Opera directory and its subdirectories. Then, the Selftest engine
      creates a file with C++ code based on all the *.ot-files called
      <em>optestsuite.cpp</em>. The <em>optestsuite.cpp</em> is compiled
      normally and linked with the rest of Opera.

    <p>
      The simplest way to run the tests in Opera is to pass <tt>-test</tt> as a
      command line parameter to Opera. However, since we are only interested in
      the tutorial tests, we want to limit the tests running to the ones with a
      group starting with the string tutorial. Therefore, we will use
      pass <tt>-test=tutorial*</tt> on the command line.

    <p>
      To make it easier for you, all of the examples in the tutorial are placed
      in the directory <em>modules/selftest/documentation/tutorial</em>.  All
      the names ends with ".disabled". To enable <em>"tutorial 1"</em>
      and <em>"tutorial 2"</em>, rename <em>tutorial1.ot.disabled</em>
      to <em>tutorial1.ot</em>, and rename
      <em>tutorial2.ot.disabled</em> to <em>tutorial2.ot</em>.

    <p>
      Once you have renamed the files, recompile opera and change the command
      line argument.  You will see something similar to the following:

      <pre>
 =========================================================================
 Opera Testsuite
 =========================================================================

 =========================================================================
 E:/src/operaclean/opera-windows7/modules/selftest/documentation/tutorial/tutorial1.ot(2):  tutorial 1
 =========================================================================
 Hello world ................................................... Passed

 =========================================================================
 E:/src/operaclean/opera-windows7/modules/selftest/documentation/tutorial/tutorial2.ot(2):  tutorial 2
 =========================================================================
 Fail Hello world .............................................. FAILED
 E:/src/operaclean/opera-windows7/modules/selftest/documentation/tutorial/tutorial2.ot(8): 'i' should be equal to 'j'
 =========================================================================
 2 tests run, 1 test failed, 0 tests skipped, 1 test OK
 Place a breakpoint in testsuite_break_here() to debug the failed test
 =========================================================================
      </pre>
    <p>
      As we were expecting, the first test passed, and the second test failed.
      In Windows, you can click on the line describing the error, to get to the
      line in the *.ot-file that failed. In Emacs on Unix you can use <code>M-x
      compile</code> to run the testsuite, the output is compatible with the gcc
      error messages, and you can thus use the next-error function.

    <p>
      As you can see in the end description, you are adviced to place a
      breakpoint in <code>testsuite_break_here()</code>. When you do that, you
      will reach the breakpoint just before the failure message is output.

    <p>
      It is also possible to place breakpoints in the .ot-files most of the
      time, but sometimes the line-numbers get confused, specifically, you
      cannot place breakpoints in empty tests.

    <p>
      If you have been able to do all the steps above, got the expected results,
      and understood approximately what was going on, you are ready to go to the
      more advanced tutorials. If you did not get here safely, try once again
      and be more thorough. If you fail once again, ask
      <a href=mailto:kilsmo@opera.com>kilsmo@opera.com</a> or
      <a href=mailto:ph@opera.com>ph@opera.com</a> for help.

      <h2>HTML / XML</h2>

      The selftest system has <a href="manual.html#html">a built-in convenience
      function</a> that is used to set the contents of the current document,
      where the current document is defined as the one available from the tests
      in <tt>state.doc</tt> from the C++-tests, or the currently active document
      in the ecmascript tests (the one <tt>document</tt> points to).
    <p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <pre>
 html {
     //! &lt;title>Example&lt;/title>
     //! &lt;h1>Example&lt;/h1>
     //! The content of the current document will be set
     //! to this text.
 }
      </pre>

      This example also introduces
      the <a href='manual.html#stringcomment'><tt>//!</tt> syntax</a>.  It is
      used to simplify the writing of HTML in the testfiles.
