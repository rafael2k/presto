test("Leaking test") leakcheck;
{
  char* str = new char[10];
  verify(1 == 1);
}

test("Leaking test that will also fail") leakcheck;
{
  char* str = new char[10];
  verify(2 == 3);

{
  char* str = new char[10];
  verify(4 == 4);
  delete [] str;
}

test("A failing test that is leaking") leakcheck;
{
  char* str = new char[10];
  verify(5 == 6);
  delete [] str;
}

test("A failing test that is not leaking using finally") leakcheck;

<p>
With leakcheck, a test will report memory leaks. Memory allocated while running the test, which is not
deallocated, will be reported as leaked. Selftest is using the operating system's leak reporting tool, so
the output will differ between Windows and Linux. A test that is failing and all allocated memory hasn't
been deallocated, will be reported as leaking memory.
<p>
If you are using finally, you can add code that always will run, even if the test fail. If you are using
leackcheck, it will be practical to use finally, to avoid getting memory leak reports when a test fail.
