<h1>The internals of the selftest system</h1>

This currently very unstructured and messy document describes the
internal workings of the selftest system, both the parser/compiler and
the runtime.

<h1>The runtime</h1>


<h2>Initializing and running the testsuite</h2>

<h3>TestSuite::main( int *argc, char *argv[] )</h3>

This function should be called just after opera has been initialized,
usually from <tt>main</tt>, <tt>WinMain</tt> or equivalent function.
<p>
It parses test-suite specific arguments.
</p>
<p>If <tt>now</tt> is supplied as part of one of them, it runs all tests
that does not require initialization and then tries to exit opera. In
that case this function will not return.</p>


<p>If there is a test argument, but no
<tt>now</tt> part, a flag is set, the testsuite arguments are removed
from argv, and argc is decremented to match.</p>

<h3>void TestSuite::run( )</h3>

<p>This function should be called when opera has been fully
initialized, just before the messageloop is entered.</p>

<p>If the testsuite is to be run, this function will send a message to
itself that causes the TestSuite::step() function to be called.</p>


<h3>void TestSuite::step()</h3>

This function is called from the message handler in opera. 

<p>It runs one step of the testsuite, which basically means that it
runs the current test, or a part of the current test if it uses delay, or requires a
document and no window with a document is available.
</p>

<h2>Testsuite structure</h2>

This information is totally useless unless you plan to change how the testsuite works.

<p>
Each testgroup is internally represented as a class implementing the TestGroup interface.

<pre>
class TestGroup
{
protected:
	int TS_next_test;
	int TS_skip_group;

public:
	virtual int TS_step() = 0;
	virtual TestGroup *TS_next() = 0;
	virtual void TS_init() = 0;
	virtual void TS_exit() = 0;
};
</pre>
The very first time TestSuite::step is called it creates an instance of the
first testgroup, and calls TS_init in it.
<p>
The rest of the time it keeps calling TS_step in the current testgroup
until it returns 0, then it calls TS_exit() in the current group, then
TS_next() to get the next group, and if it did get a new group it
calls TS_init() in it and sets it as the current group, and deletes
the old group.</p>

<p>If there are no more groups TestSuite::step prints a summary of the
testresults and returns 0, signaling that the message loop should
exit. This is currently done in mhpi.cpp by calling exit()
directly.</p>

<p>If TestSuite::step() returns 1, mhpi.cpp immediately posts a new
MSG_TESTSUITE_STEP message, which will cause it to call step() again,
if any other number is returned mhpi.cpp will simply return, this is
used to implement asynchronous tests, they will post a
MSG_TESTSUITE_STEP message once they are done.

<tt>html</tt>, <tt>ecmascript</tt> and <tt>manual</tt> tests are always asynchronous</p>

<h1>The parser</h1>

The parser is a program written in <a
href='http://pike.ida.liu.se/'>Pike</a> that locates all files with an
extension <tt>.ot</tt> in the source directories, parses them and then
generates a C++-file using a template file.

<h1>Locating source files</h1>

The program starts by recursively locating all files with a name that
ends with <tt>.ot</tt> but does not start with <tt>.</tt>. It then parses each file
in the order they were located (the order is, however, largely
irrelevant).

<h1>Parsing</h1>

<img src='selftest_parser.png' align=right>


<h2>Tokenization</h2>

The first pass of the parsing is a simple tokenization of the input
data, done using the Parser.Pike module in pike. This is only done if
the .ot-file has changed since last time it was parsed. Since pike
allows all tokens that are allowed in C++, this works surprisingly
well.

<p>
Each token-object is annotaded with the filename and the linenumber where it was found.
</p>

<where>This code is imported from the pike runtime library, see the 
directory &lt;pikedir&gt;/lib/modules/Parser.pmod/, files Pike.pmod and C.pmod</where>

<h2>Building the tree</h2> 

The tokens are then grouped in such a way that lists ({}, (), [] etc)
are grouped, recursively, into a single node, with subnodes
representing each element in the list. This is done since it greatly
simplifies the other passes.

<where>This code recides in the function <tt>group()</tt> in NodeUtil.pmod</where>

<h2>String comments</h2>

Then the parsetree is recursively searched to locate all 
"string comments", that is, comments on the form <tt>//! &lt;text here&gt;</tt>
which are converted to strings (in this case the string <tt>"&lt;text here&gt\n"</tt>)

<where>Look no further than parse_tests.pike convert_special_comments</where>

<h2>Comment removal</h2>

Then all comments are removed
<where>This one is in NodeUtil.pmod remove_comments</where>

<p>After this stage the parsed tokens are serialized and saved to disk
in a cache-file.</p>


<h2>Table, foreach and friends</h2>

After the grouping and stringification, the code is run through a
multi-pass parser that handles the <tt>table</tt>, <tt>foreach</tt> and <tt>iterate</tt>
keywords. It also search for classnames the be used for the
transformation of the global secion.

<p>
The preprocessor is run once for each time a foreach or iterate is
expanded in the parsetree, to allow foreach and iterate inside other
foreach and iterate.
</p>

<p>tables are removed from the tree completely, and added to a global
list of tables</p>

<p>foreach is expanded by looping over the table, and then duplicating
the nodes in the foreach block once for each loop, with the
identifiers used in the foreach statement replaced with the values for
the current table row, and the special syntax <tt>$(identifier)</tt> replaced
anywhere (inside any other tokens) with the same value.

<p>iterate() is basically replaced with a for loop, and as a
side-effect sets a flag in the table that causes it to be included it
in the generated C++-code.</p>

<where>The main code can be found in the function preprocess in
parse_tests.pike</where>

<where>The token replacement code for foreach can be found in the
NodeUtil.pmod::replace_identifier and NodeUtil.pmod::replace_macro
functions.</where>

<h2>Parsing the tree</h2>

The top-level of the parsetree is then parsed to locate all other
things handled by the selftest system, such as tests, group
definitions, include statements etc. See the <a
href=manual.html>manual</a> for a list of the supported keywords.

<p> Once a test or group has been located, a new Group or Test object
is created, the latter added to the list of tests in the current
group, and the group added to a toplevel list of groups.

<where>This code can be found in parse_tests.pike::parse_file (the
while(1) loop). This function is also where the calls the passes above
recides</where>


<h1>Transformations</h1>

The transformations are mainly performed when code is added to the
test or group (as in the case of <tt>verify</tt> or the global section)

<h2>Global section</h2>

<h3>Moving definitions of class methods</h3>
<p>
Move out all TYPE ClassName::FunctionName( TYPE ) { } blocks to the
toplevel scope, to be compatible with booth vc++ and gcc.
</p>
<p>
In the process the ClassName has to be fixed to include the
classname of the testgroup class.
</p>
<where>parse_tests.pike::recursively_fix_class_names</where>


<h3>Rewriting toplevel variables with initialization assignments</h3>

Code such as <tt>int q = 10;</tt> cannot be included directly in the
global section, since each testgroup is converted to a class, and that
kind of variable initialization is not allowed for class-local
variables.

<p>
They are thus moved to the <tt>init</tt> section (thus basically is
moved to the constructor of the class).

<where>The function parse_tests.pike::move_initializers</where>

<h3>Locating and moving extern declarations and defines</h3>


All <tt>#define</tt> directives and <tt>extern</tt> declarations are moved to the
start of the test-group, to make it possible to use them in the tests.

<h2>Test sections</h2>

<h3>verify</h3>


<h1>Code generation</h1>

<h2>Not up to date</h2>

<h2>The template file</h2>

A file named <tt>template.cpp</tt> is read. In this file the following
strings (Note: not identifiers this time, this is a low-level replace
without parsing) are replaced:

<h3>__YEAR__</h3>

The year when the file was generated. This is used to update the
copyright header in the template file, e.g.: "Copyright (C)
2002-__YEAR__ Opera Software AS"

<h3>__TESTS__</h3>

All the classes that makes up the test-groups, and in them all that
methods that make make up the tests, and their subtests. Also all
methods defined in classes in the tests, and the success variables
used to indicate if a file has succeeded or not.

<h3>__DEFINES__</h3>

All defines and extern declarations found in the tests.

<h3>__FIRST_GROUP__</h3>

The name of the class that is the first testgroup. Used in the runtime
to get it all started.

<h3>__INCLUDES__</h3>

All includes generated from <tt>include</tt> statements, with associated
#line indicators that show where the include was found.

<h3>__TABLES__</h3>

All the tables used in the iterate.


<where>The code that outputs code can be found in various places in
parse_tests.pike, the easiest way to locate it is probably to go to
the main method in parse_tests.pike and start from there.
<p>
However, if you look for <tt>define</tt> and <tt>call</tt> methods in the various
classes in parse_tests.pike you will find most of the code.
</p>
</where>


<h2>Dependencies</h2>

The testgroups and their tests are reordered in such a way that any
dependencies are resolved, that is, if test A depends on test B, it
will be outputted after B. In the same way, if a test in group A
depends on a test in group B, the group B will be called before group
A, and currently also placed before group A in the file.

<where>parse_tests.pike::resolv</where>

<h2>Writing the result</h2>

The final code is compared to the exising optestsuite.cpp (if any). If
there are no changes, nothing is written.

<where>parse_tests.pike::main</where>

<h3>A note about #line</h3>

If you open optestsuite.cpp after it has been generated, you will
notice that there are a lot of #line statements in it, unless you are
running the parse_test.pike program in debug mode (see
parse_tests.pike::main, this mode is intended to be used to debug the
testsuite generation process, not to debug tests)
