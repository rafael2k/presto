so-called radix-tree is something simlar to what's called a &ldquo;Patricia
trie&ldquo; in some publications &ndash; where &ldquo;leafs&ldquo; in
the tree is lists with words containing the part (the end) of the
words which is not implicated by the leafs positions in the tree. In
the spellchecker are characters in the words that should be stored in
the tree mapped to &ldquo;indexes&ldquo;. Each index can have several
different characters that maps to it, for example is upper-/lower-
case versions of the same letter mapped to the same index.
Furthermore can characters be explicitly mapped together by the <B>MAP</B>
keyword in the affix-file (<B>.aff</B>).</FONT></P>

&ldquo;node&ldquo; in the radix-tree is represented by an
<B>OpSpellCheckerRadix</B> object. This object is an an practice an
array of <B>RadixEntry</B> objects, and, an RadixEntry object is in
practice a 32-bit value (on a 32-bit platform), or a 64-bit value (on
a 64-bit platform). This value is either a pointer or a counter.
Counters are only used during the build-up of the tree, and the
purposes of the counters are described later. However, when the

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The last question-mark
remaining about the word-units is what happens when more word should
be added to a linked list of word-units, but they are not yet
available. Then we use the offset (which also functions as next
word-unit pointer) described in <B>(2)</B> for <B>figure 1.2</B> for
storing the position where we should continue to add the next word
when we later encounter it. As mentioned, this is not a bit-offset,
and not even a byte offset &ndash; but a two-byte offset. Therefore
we'll need to store the exact bit-location where we can continue <I>at</I>
that offset, and not only that &ndash; we also need to store the
previous word completely (except of the initial part implicated by
the radix-tree position). The reason for the latter is that the
previous word might be stored only partitially if it &ldquo;copies&ldquo;
indexes from the word before that word &ndash; and that word in turn
might be copying indexed from it's preceding word, etc. For not
having to scan through all the words in the word-unit list when we
should continue, we therefore stores a &ldquo;full&ldquo; temporary
