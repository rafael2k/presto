<h1>Regular Expression Engine</h1>

$Id$

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The regexp module provides a regular expression compiler and a
matcher engine.  Both correspond to regular expressions as defined by
the ECMAScript specification, ES-262 3rd edition (<a
href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">download
here</a>), plus some extensions (documented below).</p>

<p>Compatibility with the ECMAScript specification is a nonnegotiable
requirement: the ECMAScript engine uses the regexp module for its
regular expression work.</p>

<p>The current version, <b>fsa_1</b>, was extracted from the
<b>linear_b_2</b> and <b>futhark</b> ECMAScript engines.  Its focus is
on correctness, footprint, and low memory use, and not so much on
performance.</p>


<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>There are several use cases for this module:</p>
<dl>
<dt>ECMAScript regular expression matching

<dd>Regular expressions are used extensively in scripting.  To support
    scripting, the regexp module must support the standard, but must also
	support common extensions, and must have good performance both for
	compiling and executing regular expressions.

<dt>Regular expression matching in M2

<dd>No information is available right now about how M2 uses the regexp
    engine

<dt>Regular expression matching in Webforms

<dd>No information is available right now about how Webforms uses the
    regexp engine.

</dl>


<h2>APIs</h2>

<p>The engine exports a convenient API for use by other modules that
need to do basic regular expression matching, and a less convenient
API for use by the ECMAScript engine.</p>

<p><a href="api/index.html">Generated API documentation</a>, if you've run
Doxygen on this module.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>There are no features used or defined by this module.</p>


<h2>Subset engine</h2>

<p>For footprint-constrained systems the module can be configured to
use a subset engine.  This accepts a "useful" subset of the regular
expression language, and saves a few KB of code.  However, if you use
this you will run into sites that don't work, and perhaps other
regressions.  The subset engine is not very well tested.</p>

<p>The subset engine is controlled by TWEAK_REGEXP_SUBSET; see the
file module.tweaks for more information.</p>


<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>A brief summary of extensions:</p>
<ul>

<li>Backreferences out of range are treated as decimal escapes, ie, \9 is
    the TAB character if the regexp has less than 9 submatches.

<li>The characters "]", "{", and "}" stand for themselves in Atom contexts.

<li>Octal escapes are implemented where needed, so \011 is the TAB character.
    However, the interpretation that ES-262 2nd edition [sic!] gives to
    escape sequences, where \44 is interpreted as octal, is not implemented,
    even though Netscape^WMozilla^WFirefox implements it that way.

<li>Hexadecimal and unicode escapes without the requisite number of digits 
    (two and four, respectively) are treated as strings of characters.

<li>Character set escapes are allowed inside character sets, eg [\w123].

</ul>

<p>For more information search the module sources for the string
REGEXP_STRICT (this setting can be controlled by TWEAK_REGEXP_STRICT).
Each extension is documented in the source.</p>


<h2>Memory use</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>There are two APIs, the <code>OpRegExp</code> API and the
<code>RegExp</code> API.  The former API is a simple wrapper around
the latter.  It has no interfaces that Leave, and storage management
is by simple deletion of the <code>OpRegExp</code> object.  For this
reason, only the <code>RegExp</code> API will be covered in the
following.  Most points apply to the <code>OpRegExp</code> API as
well.</p>


<h3>Flow</h3>

<p>Regular expressions (<code>RegExp</code> objects) are simple
abstract data types.  One is created by invoking
<code>new&nbsp;RegExp</code> and then calling the <code>Init()</code>
method on the object.  <code>RegExp</code> objects can be shared and
contain a reference counter, initially 1.  When you want to delete it,
just call <code>DecRef()</code> on the <code>RegExp</code> object.  If
the counter is 0, the object will be deleted immediately.</p>

<p>If the call to <code>Init()</code> fails for any reason then the
<code>RegExp</code> cannot be used.  Delete it by calling
<code>DecRef()</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>Init()</code> succeeds, then the <code>RegExp</code>
represents a compiled regular expression and it has some local
heap-allocated data.  These data are deleted when the
<code>RegExp</code> object is deleted.</p>

<p>A <code>RegExp</code> object can then be used for multiple
matchings.  Some heap memory is allocated during matching for working
storage, but is always deallocated before the matcher returns.</p>


<h3>OOM policies</h3>

<p><code>TRAP/LEAVE</code> is used extensively for signalling OOM.
This is convenient because most memory is allocated from a region data
structure and not directly from the heap, so cleaning up the allocated
memory after an OOM event is easy and cheap.</p>

<p>(Client code that does not want to handle exceptions can use the
<code>OpRegExp</code> API instead.)</p>


<h3>Who is handling OOM?</h3>

<p>OOM events are always returned from calls to the APIs as exceptions
and must be handled on the outside, but the module cleans up after
itself on the way out and there is no need to call any cleanup actions
inside the module.</p>

<p>Client code should be sure to delete regular expressions whose
construction failed (by decrementing their reference counters on the
<code>RegExp</code> object).  Regular expression matchings that fail
due to OOM will not affect the <code>RegExp</code> objects, and the
object may be used for subsequent matchings.</p>


<h3>Heap memory usage</h3>

<p>Heap memory is used during compilation and during matching.  The
amount allocated during compilation is roughly proportional to the
size, measured in characters, of the regular expression.  The amount
allocated during matching is in the worst case proportional to the
length of the input.  Some optimizations are possible to make the
worst case less likely (the intensely curious are encouraged to read
<a href="TODO">the to-do list</a>).</p>

<p>FIXME: more here</p>


<h3>Stack memory usage</h3>

<p>Stack memory is used primarily during compilation.  The amount used
is proportional to the nesting level of the regular expression:
parenthesized subexpression are parsed by a new activation of the
parser.  Most regular expressions are very shallow, so in practice
this is not an issue.  It is however possible to construct regular
expressions that will blow any stack on any computer.  The easiest way
to fix this, should it be necessary, is to put a static bound on the
number of nesting levels.</p>


<h3>Static memory usage</h3>

<p>The module has no global variables at this time and has no static
data.  No data are cached on behalf of the module, and there are no
data to free on exit.</p>


<h3>Temporary buffers</h3>

<p>The module does not use the tempbuffers from the memory manager.</p>


<h3>Memory tuning</h3>

<p>Memory usage (and performance) can be tuned by adjusting some of
the obscure parameters in module.tweaks, but this should not generally
be necessary.  See comments in module.tweaks.</p>


<h3>Tests</h3>

<p>Right now there are no selftests that test for leaks or OOM.
However, some tests that can be used to test memory behavior are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large expressions
<li>Complicated expressions (involving many different operators and strings)
</ul>
<p>I plan to add some of these, and leak checks, to the selftests.</p>


<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>Coverage can be had by running the ECMAScript test suite (even just
the <code>RegExp</code> tests).  Eventually many of these will be
moved into the regexp module and coverage can be had by running
selftest.</p>


<h3>Design choices</h3>

<p>By allocating most objects from regions, we take the pressure off
<code>malloc()</code> and reduce the storage needs (no object headers
are needed).  Also, this simplifies memory management and virtually
guarantees that leaks will not occur.</p>

<p>The matcher engine uses some auxiliary data structures.  These too
are allocated from regions, but in addition the objects in these
regions are managed by a simple garbage collector (because liveness is
very hard to track accurately).  See the implementation documentation
for more information.</p>


<h3>Suggestions and improvements</h3>

<p>A number of issues are mentioned in <a href="TODO">the to-do
list</a>.</p>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation is described in general terms in a large comment
block at the beginning of the file <a
href="api/regexp__advanced__api_8cpp.html">regexp_advanced_api.cpp</a>.</p>
