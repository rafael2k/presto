 <h2><abbr title="Out of memory">OOM</abbr> policies</h2>
 <p>When memory allocation fails, the layout module will signal and
  check this in the following ways:</p>

 <h3>LEAVE</h3>
 <p>Except in module initialization (the LayoutModule class), LEAVE is
  not used.</p>

 <h3>Return values from methods</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>OpStatus / OpBoolean</dt>
  <dd>Widely used, especially in the cascade code.</dd>

  <dt>LAYST</dt>
  <dd>LAYST is a status type defined and used by the layout module. It
   may be used to indicate OOM conditions, in which case its value is
   LAYOUT_OUT_OF_MEMORY</dd>

  <dt>FALSE</dt>
  <dd>The value FALSE of type BOOL</dd>

  <dt>NULL-pointer</dt>
  <dd>Sometimes a NULL-pointer is returned to indicate OOM</dd>
 </dl>

 <h3>Flags</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>HLDocProfile</dt>
  <dd>The methods GetIsOutOfMemory() and SetIsOutOfMemory() of the
  HLDocProfile class in the logdoc module are both used in the layout
  module</dd>
  <dt>TraversalObject</dt>
  <dd>The methods IsOutOfMemory() and SetOutOfMemory() of the
  TraversalObject class are used to signal OOM conditions</dd>
 </dl>

 <h2>Who is handling OOM?</h2>
 <p>The layout module itself does nothing else than notify the caller
  of it and perform necessary clean-up to avoid memory leaks, if
  something got incompletely initialized before the allocation failure
  occurred.</p>

 <h2>Where and when is memory allocated</h2>
 <p>During initialization of Opera, LayoutModule allocates some
  memory, which is not freed before Opera shuts down. This is memory
  that is so frequently used by the layout engine that performance
  would suffer if not kept in memory at all times. There are a few
  memory pools for objects very frequently allocated and freed, most
  notably LayoutProperties, of which several are allocated temporarily
  during reflow and traversal. The number of total simultaneous
  objects of this type may be as high as the maximum depth of the HTML
  tree in the document to be reflowed or traversed. The total number
  of objects allocated during a reflow or traversal may be as high as
  the total number of elements in the document.</p>
 <p>The memory allocated by LayoutModule is the only permanently
  allocated memory in the layout module. The remaining memory
  allocations in this module are triggered by document loading.</p>
 <p>When building the layout tree (reflow), memory is allocated for
 each layout box (normally one box per HTML element) generated.</p>
 <p>Memory is temporarily allocated and freed during reflow and
 traversal (LayoutProperties objects), but this memory will normally
 be taken from the memory pool in LayoutModule.</p>

 <h2>Heap memory used</h2>
 <p>The amount of heap memory is proportional with the size of the
  document that is to be laid out. Each HTML block element will take
  xxx bytes in the layout module. Each text node will take xxx
  bytes. The layout module does not copy the actual text -- it is
  served by and shared with the logdoc module.</p>

 <h2>Stack memory used</h2>
 <p>The layout module has very few stack-allocated arrays, but a
  couple exist. Both are relatively small (100 characters) and marked
  with &quot;ARRAY OK&quot;.</p>
 <p>The function call stack depth depends on the HTML tree
 depth. During traversal and reflow, the layout module will typically
 add two function calls to the stack when entering an HTML
 element.</p>

 <h2>Static memory used</h2>
 <p>Whatever the LayoutModule object allocates should be counted as
  &quot;static memory&quot;, since it is allocated (on the heap) when
  Opera starts up and freed when Opera exits. In addition there is one
  small constant array for Roman numbers.</p>

 <h2>Caching</h2>
 <p>Most of the data allocated and kept by the layout module
 (typically Box and Content derived classes), can (almost) be
 considered to be a kind of a cache. Currently, form element content,
 plug-ins and applets are owned by the layout module (but they could
 probably be moved elsewhere), but apart from this, there is nothing
 in the layout module that cannot be regenerated from the data in the
 logdoc module.</p>

 <p>The layout boxes (the Box and Content classes) are normally kept
 in memory as long as the owning HTML_Element is there. The layout
 boxes are mainly there to speed up traversal (by a lot -- this
 speed-up is really essential most of the time while displaying or
 interacting with the document). The box data is needed only when the
 tree is to be traversed, but generating the boxes (reflow) is not a
 fast operation. Each paint event, each mouse motion event, (and other
 events) will trigger a traversal.</p>

 <h2>Clean-up before exiting</h2>
 <p>When all documents are freed from memory, all that is left of
 allocations in the layout module should be the ones done by the
 LayoutModule object. When Opera exits, the LayoutModule object is
 deleted, which will free the remaining memory kept by the layout
 module.</p>

 <h2>Temporary buffers</h2>
 <p>The layout module uses the temporary buffer owned by MemoryManager
  very rarely. The only case where it used, is when setting and
  getting the text from OPTION elements. When getting the text, the
  temporary buffer is returned from the callee in the layout module to
  the caller in a different module. The temporary memory buffer is
  involved in a lot of operations here as well, and even if this is
  (hopefully) a safe thing to do today, this solution is very
  fragile.</p>

 <h2>Memory usage tuning</h2>
 <p>There are no direct ways of tuning memory usage. However, some
 features, such as BiDi, requires additional memory, and can be
 disabled to reduce memory usage (and functionality).</p>

 <h2>Memory usage checking</h2>
 <p>None</p>

 <h2>How to get high coverage</h2>
 <p>Memory allocations are done from a relatively few sites in the
  layout module. The main sites are:
  <ul>
   <li>The LayoutModule object</li>
   <li>When creating a layout box (Box + Content)</li>
   <li>When initializing reflow state object during reflow (each Box
    and Content object have their own object)</li>
   <li>When creating a new chain in the cascade (a LayoutProperties
    object) during reflow and traversal. Since LayoutProperties objects
    are allocated from a pool, actual memory allocation will normally
    not take place, unless we need more LayoutProperties than the pool
    can provide (deep HTML trees)</li>
   <li>When adding a line (of text and other inline elements) to a
    container (block)
   <li>When laying out text nodes. There is a structure per layout box
    that contains various information about each word. For large text
    nodes, we may allocate quite big chunks of data here.</li>
   <li>SVG</li>
  </ul>

  Laying out any document containing text will cause memory to be
  allocated from all the above sites. There are however slightly
  different allocation sites for each Box / Content type.</p>

  <p>In addition we have these sites:

  <ul>
   <li>BiDi calculation</li>
   <li>BUTTON, SELECT, OPTION, OPTGROUP elements</li>
   <li>Elements with overflow:scroll</li>
   <li>Run-ins converted a block / inline</li>
   <li>Page breaking</li>
   <li>Java applets</li>
   <li>Tables</li>
   <li>Text search</li>
   <li>Link traversal</li>
   <li>WantToModifyProperties</li>
   <li>CURRENT_STYLE_SUPPORT</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

 <h2>Design choices</h2>
 <p>TODO</p>

 <h2>Possible improvements</h2>
 <dl>

  <dt>Reduce the size of an HTMLayoutProperties object</dt>
  <dd>The HTMLayoutProperties structure is large (it took 600 bytes on
  an x86 architecture when this documentation was written), and during
  layout and traversal several simultaneous instances are created, and
  accessed extensively. On devices with low memory performance, this
  may be a problem.</dd>

  <dt>Avoid potentially dangerous usage of the MemoryManager temporary
   buffers</dt>
  <dd>If the layout module needs temporary buffers frequently, a
   temporary buffer owned and used by the layout module should be
   created, instead of using the global MemoryManager temporary
   buffer</dd>

  <dt>Delete layout boxes when not needed for a while</dt>
  <dd>If it is unlikely that the layout boxes are to be traversed for
   a while, we could consider deleting them (rebuilding them is
   expensive). However, currently, some layout boxes keep data which
   it is not possible to regenerate if deleted, so we need to solve
   those issues first.</dd>
