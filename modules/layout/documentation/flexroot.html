 <h2>About this document</h2>

 <p>This is a specification. We try not to deal with implementation
 details or bugs in Opera more than necessary here.</p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>According to the CSS spec, the initial containing block width - in
 Opera also called "layout viewport width" - is the same as the window
 width (if the document is the root frame). FlexRoot changes
 this. FlexRoot is a rendering mode where the initial containing block
 width is allowed to grow beyond the width of the browser window (and
 even get narrower as well). It is suitable in environments where the
 screen width is narrower than what a web developer typically
 assumes. Its goal is to make web pages appear as similar as possible
 to what they look like on a desktop system, without making usage and
 navigation difficult. It is basically an improvement of the old
 &quot;Virtual Screen Width&quot; feature, where an initial containing
 block width was hardcoded (to e.g. 640px). With FlexRoot the layout
 viewport width depends on page content. This means that a page should
 never be wider than "necessary". The layout viewport will grow wider
 only if wide content demands it, typically when large absolute widths
 or horizontal paddings/margins/borders are specified, or when widths
 are auto on replaced content with large intrinsic widths.</p>

 <p>In most cases it is logical and desirable to combine FlexRoot with
 the &quot;Limit paragraph width&quot; (aka. ERA text-wrap)
 feature. Combining FlexRoot with adaptive zoom to find a suitable
 initial zoom level is also useful.</p>

 <h2>FlexRoot minimum width and maximum width</h2>

 <p>Two parameters are used to control FlexRoot behavior; minimum
 width and maximum width. Minimum width is by default the same as the
 window width (if the document is the root frame), while maximum width
 should be set to the typical width of a "wide page", to prevent
 FlexRoot to grow beyond this limit. Some content would cause a very
 large layout viewport width otherwise. For example, &lt;div
 style="width:10000px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; would cause the layout
 viewport to become 10000px, which would mean 10000px wide lines,
 right-aligned floats placed way to the right. This is why we
 constrain the layout viewport width like this.</p>

 <p>The following is always true: minimum width <= layout viewport
 width <= maximum width</p>

 <p>Maximum width must be set for FlexRoot to be enabled, and the
 other way around: FlexRoot is enabled by setting maximum
 width. Minimum width is optional, and pretty much obsolete with the
 introduction of the 3 viewports (visual, layout and rendering
 viewports) in core 2.3 (and 2.2.1).</p>

 <p>There are two preference settings in the "User Prefs" section to
 define these values:</p>

 <h3>"FlexRoot Max Width"</h3>

 <p>Default value: 0 (disable FlexRoot)<br>Suggested value: 850<br>If
 the value is different from 0, FlexRoot is enabled, and the value
 will define the maximum number of pixels to use as the initial
 containing block width.</p>

 <h3>"FlexRoot Min Width"</h3>

 <p>Default value: 0 (derive from window width)<br>Suggested value:
 0<br>If FlexRoot is enabled, and the value is different from 0, it
 will define the minimum number of pixels to use as the initial
 containing block width. If FlexRoot is enabled, and the value is 0,
 the window width will be used as minimum width of the layout viewport
 of the root frame.</p>

 <h2>How it works</h2>

 <p>The general behavior of FlexRoot is easy to describe using CSS:
 FlexRoot uses a pseudo element that is the parent of the root HTML
 element in a document. This element will be laid out with the
 shrink-to-fit algorithm, very similar to an element with
 e.g. "position:absolute; top:auto; right:auto; bottom:auto;
 left:auto; width:auto; z-index:0;". The min-width property of this
 element will be set to FlexRoot minimum width, and the max-width
 property will be set to FlexRoot maximum width.</p>

 <p>Regarding the <a href="minmax.html#stf-alg">shrink-to-fit
 algorithm</a>, the <a href="minmax.html#available-width"><i>available
 width</i></a> input parameter is set to 0, effectively
 ignoring <a href="minmax.html#maximum-width"><i>maximum width</i></a>
 and only honor <a href="minmax.html#minimum-width"><i>minimum
 width</i></a> (along width the min-width and max-width properties
 explained in the previous paragraph). We want content that is not
 wider than absolutely necessary to keep boxes from overflowing (boxes
 that wouldn't overflow if layout viewport width were less
 constrained).</p>

 <h3>Deviations from CSS / HTML specifications / normal rendering
 mode</h3>

 <p>The previous paragraph describes all there is about FlexRoot for
  most type of content, but in some cases the CSS spec isn't
  enough:</p>

 <h4>Framesets</h4>

 <p>We use the &quot;Smart Frames&quot; algorithm (also used in
 certain ERA modes) in FlexRoot mode. No frames are allowed to create
 scrollbars; instead each frame is expanded until no scrollbars are
 needed. The top-level frameset will display scrollbars if necessary
 instead. Absolute widths specified on frames will be respected
 (unless their content is wider). Relative and percentage widths are
 relative to the layout viewport width of the root document,
 i.e. window width or the aforementioned preference defined maximum
 width, whichever is the larger value.</p>

 <h4>Absolutely (and fixed) positioned boxes</h4>

 <p>Absolutely positioned boxes contribute to the layout viewport
 width - contrary to the CSS spec (which says that such boxes should
 not affect the size of ancestor elements in any way).</p>

 <p>Only absolutely positioned boxes whose containing block is the
 root element will contribute.</p>

 <p>The idea here is that the layout viewport should be wide enough
 for all absolutely positioned boxes to fit inside it, as long as this
 is possible and reasonable.</p>

 <p>If width is absolute or auto, propagate the position
 and <a href="minmax.html#minimum-width">minimum width</a> to the
 layout viewport.</p>

 <p>If width is percent based, calculate how wide the (initial)
 containing block (layout viewport) needs to be to accommodate left,
 margin-left, border and padding. Propagate this value along with the
 box's position. This effectively means that for absolutely positioned
 boxes with percentual widths we assume that intrinsic width (child
 content width) is 0.</p>

 <h4>Fixed positioned boxes</h4>

 <p>Fixed positioned boxes will lose some of their horizontal
 "fixedness", meaning that when scrolling horizontally, fixed
 positioned may scroll along with the rest of the document. This is
 the consequence when the layout viewport becomes wider than the
 visual viewport. See
 http://projects/Core2profiles/specifications/mobile/rendering_modes.html#viewports
 for details about viewports.</p>

 <a name="percent-widths"></a>

 <h4>Percentual widths</h4>

 <p>This applies to statically and relatively positioned boxes
 only. It does not apply to replaced content, and it applies to table
 boxes only if the used value of its 'table-layout' property is
 'fixed' (the used width of a table with table-layout:auto will never
 be less than its minimum content width).</p>

 <p>An element whose width property is percent based needs special
 attention. The general assumption here is that the author doesn't
 want content inside a box with a percent based width to overflow
 it. The CSS spec is explicitly unclear about percent based widths
 inside a shrink-to-fit box, but different browsers have <b>sort
 of</b> reached a <a href="minmax.html#percent-widths">common way of
 doing it</a>. Unfortunately, that way won't do for FlexRoot, due to
 the aforementioned assumption that the author probably doesn't want
 anything to overflow.</p>

 <p>When min/max widths are propagated from a box with percentual
 width, the calculated minimum width will be multiplied by 100 and
 divided by the percentage. This is a way to tell the containing block
 that "this is how wide you have to be to prevent me from overflowing
 you when I resolve my percentage against your width". This also
 applies if width &gt; 100%. The larger percentage width a box has,
 the narrower its containing block needs to be to prevent its content
 from overflowing. The containing block width requirement
 'needed_inside' for the area defined by box-sizing (either
 content-box or border-box) with percentage 'p'
 and <a href="minmax.html#minimum-width">minimum width</a>
 'minimum_width' is calculated like this:</p>

 <pre class="code">
  needed_inside = minimum_width * 100 / p</pre>

 <p>Minimum width of content inside table cells and captions are
 scaled in the exact same manner, as long as the table affects
 FlexRoot.</p>

 <p>When a box with percentual width has non-zero horizontal margin
 (and for box-sizing:content-box: padding and/or border as well), it
 needs to fit inside the "unused percentage". The parts of the box not
 included by its box-sizing need to fit inside 100 minus the width
 property percentage.</p>

 <p>Let 'p' be the percentage of the width property. Let
 'outside_width' be the sum of margin-left and margin-right, plus, if
 box-sizing is content-box, border-left-width, border-right-width,
 padding-left and padding-right. Then, if 'p' is less than 100, the
 containing block width requirement 'needed_outside' is calculated
 like this:</p>

 <pre class="code">
 needed_outside = outside_width * 100 / (100 - p)</pre>

 <p>If 'p' is 100 or more, no matter how large the containing block
 width is, it cannot prevent the box from overflowing. Give up and let
 'needed_inside' be 0.</p>

 <p>Finally, the containing block width requirement
 'containing_block_propagation' for this box becomes:</p>

 <pre class="code">
 containing_block_propagation = max(needed_outside, needed_inside)</pre>

 <p>Example 1:<br>
 <pre class="code">
 &lt;div style="width:40%;"&gt;
   &lt;div style="width:200px; height:20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

 <p>Width propagated from the parent DIV:</p>

 <pre class="code">
  needed_inside = 200px * 100 / 40 = 500px
  needed_outside = 0
  containing_block_propagation = max(500px, 0) = 500px</pre>

 <p>Example 2, introducing border:<br>
 <pre class="code">
 &lt;div style="width:40%; border:20px solid blue;"&gt;
   &lt;div style="width:200px; height:20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

 <p>Width propagated from the parent DIV:</p>
 <pre class="code">
  needed_inside = 200px * 100 / 40 = 500px
  needed_outside = (20px + 20px) * 100 / (100 - 40) = 66px
  containing_block_propagation = max(500px, 66px) = 500px</pre>

 <p>Example 3, larger border:<br>
 <pre class="code">
 &lt;div style="width:40%; padding:0 178px;"&gt;
   &lt;div style="width:200px; height:20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;</pre>

 <p>Width propagated from the parent DIV:</p>
 <pre class="code">
  needed_inside = 200px * 100 / 40 = 500px
  needed_outside = (178px + 178px) * 100 / (100 - 40) = 593px
  containing_block_propagation = max(500px, 593px) = 593px</pre>

 <h4>Non-visible overflow</h4>

 <p>If overflow is different from 'visible', 0 may be used in minimum
   width propagation (this depends on core version; there are
   arguments for setting it to 0, and arguments against it, and we
   have already toggled our behavior several times; see bug CORE-16940
   for the most recent story). For FlexRoot, however, we propagate the
   actual minimum width of the child contents, i.e. we treat it like
   we treat any other container.</p>

 <h4>To do?</h4>

 <p>We may want to handle percent based horizontal margin and padding
 in a special way. Same goes for min-width and max-width.</p>

 <p>Should we use min-width in favor of width, if min-width is
 non-zero?</p>

 <p>There is currently nothing that prevents content of absolutely
 positioned boxes with percentual width from overflowing; we assume
 that intrinsic width is 0. This should probably be amended.</p>

 <p>Absolutely positioned boxes with left:auto and non-auto right
 should be handled better; i.e. attempt to avoid negative overflow of
 initial containing block.</p>
