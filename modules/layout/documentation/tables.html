 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>This document attempts to describe the table layout algorithm used
 in Opera - in particular the automatic table layout algorithm. The
 CSS spec <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#auto-table-layout">doesn't
 even attempt to describe this algorithm decently</a>. It does however
 state that <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#q1">&quot;For the
 automatic table layout algorithm, some widely deployed
 implementations have achieved relatively close
 interoperability&quot;</a>. And we're trying our best to do exactly
 that, mostly by following IE as closely as
 possible/reasonable. Mozilla behavior is also taken into account.</p>

 <p>NOTE: This specification is not yet complete. It does not describe
 rowspan or height calculation.</p>

 <h2>Overview</h2>

 <p>Table layout requires two passes in the layout engine. In the <a
 href="#pass-1">first (initial) pass</a>, width information (desired
 width, percentage) about each cell and column box is gathered and
 stored in a <a href="#column-array">column array</a>. The <a
 href="#minmax">minimum and maximum</a> width of each cell is also
 calculated. When all cell minimum and maximum widths have been found,
 the total table minimum and maximum width is calculated. In the <a
 href="#pass-2">second (final) pass</a>, the total width of the table
 is calculated, followed by calculating the <a
 href="#distribute-space">width of each column</a>. Then every cell is
 reflowed according to the new column widths.</p>

 <h2><a name="minmax">Definition of minimum, maximum, desired and percentage width</a></h2>

 <p>Definition of the different width types - minimum, maximum,
 desired and percentage width - in the context of table box,

 <ul>

  <li>Special rules for cells with colspan &gt; 1 apply</li>

  <li>Resolving column percentages in a table with auto width is
  described <a href="#auto-percent">here</a></li>

  <li>There is also a width type called <i>normal minimum
  width</i>. This will always be the "true" minimum width. It is
  always the same as <i>minimum width</i> in normal layout mode, while
  in other layout modes (ERA) <i>minimum width</i> may be less than
  <i>normal minimum width</i>. In non-normal layout modes, <i>minimum
  width</i> is sqeezed aggressively. Replaced content may be shrunk,
  and words may e.g. be split over several lines, if containing block
  width is insufficient.<br> This will always be true: minimum width
  &lt;= normal minimum width &lt;= maximum width</li>

  <li>Observe the fact that minimum and maximum widths are never
  affected by the width of the table or the containing block of the
  table</li>

 </ul>

 <p>How to calculate minimum and maximum widths is described in
   greater detail in the documentation of the
   <a href="minmax.html">min/max width calculation and propagation
   algorithm.</a></p>

 <h2><a name="column-array">The column array</a></h2>

 <div class="coderef">ColumnInfo</div>

 <p>An array of columns is created and updated when laying out cell
 and column boxes. A table cell with colspan <i>colspan</i> belongs to
 <i>colspan</i> entries in the column array (or, more often simply called
 &quot;columns&quot;). A column box with span <i>span</i> defines
 <i>span</i> entries in the column array. The first table cell in a
 table-row belongs to the first column (and <i>colspan-1</i> following
 columns) (unless it is pushed to a successive column by a cell with
 rowspan on a preceding row). The next cell in a row belongs to the
 column (or, with colspan, columns) following the last column occupied
 by the previous cell. A column entry refers to zero or one column
 box. It contains width information about (but does not directly refer
 to) zero or more cells.</p>

 <p>For ERA, when TrueTables are enabled, each entry also keeps track
 of how many non-colspanned cells in each column are suitable
 (positive) or unsuitable (negative) for TrueTables.</p>

 <h2>Layout algorithm details</h2>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::ComputeSize(),
 TableContent::Layout()</div>

 <p>This chapter deals with the entire algorithm used for automatic
 table layout, step by step.</p>

 <p>Very many (but not all) of the other layout box types require only
 one layout pass. This is however only possible if the width of a box
 can be calculated without laying it out first. This is not the case
 for table boxes. Two passes are required.</p>

 <h3><a name="pass-1">Initial layout pass (measure pass)</a></h3>

 <p>Before we can calculate the width of the table, we need to know
 the desired, percentage, minimum and maximum width of each of its <a
 href="#column-array">columns</a>. Before we can calculate that, we
 must know the desired, percentage, minimum and maximum width of each
 cell box. The only way to find this, is by laying out every cell box
 (without knowing their size).</p>

 <h4>Lay out every column and cell box</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableCellBox::Layout(),
 TableContent::UpdateColumnWidths(),
 TableContent::CalculateColumnMinMaxWidths()</div>

 <p>For each table-cell box, feed the table's column array with
 desired, percentage, content minimum and maximum width. For each
 column box, feed the table's column array with desired and percentage
 width.</p>

 <p>Cell or column box width values
 (minimum/maximum/desired/percentage) replace values in the <a
 href="#column-array">column array</a> if a value is higher than what
 is already stored in the column array. A cell with desired width
 specified will constrain maximum width to desired width - it may be
 less, but not more. Note that this rule may cause a column's minimum
 width to be larger than its maximum width, which reduces the chance
 of the column receiving excess space later, when <a
 href="#distribute-space">distributing available table width</a>.

 <p>Column box desired/percentage width is honored only if the <a
 href="#column-array">column</a> contains at least one non-colspanned
 cell with auto width. The column box's desired width is propagated to
 such cells.</p>

 Cell and column widths are fed to the layout engine in plain document
 element order. In fact, order is irrelevant, unless there are cells
 with colspan &gt; 1. In that case we feed them sorted on their
 colspan, ascendingly. This way the column minimum and maximum widths
 become as narrow as possible. If there are two or more cells with the
 same colspan in the table, feed them in layout stack order -
 i.e. first row first. This makes us pretty compatible with IE. In
 Firefox and Konqueror, on the other hand, row order seems to make no
 difference.</p>

 <h5>TrueTable detection</h5>

 <div class="coderef">Content::IsTrueTableCandidate()</div>

 <p>In TrueTable mode (typically enabled in SSR and CSSR mode), each
 table cell with colspan == 1 needs to specify if its content may look
 like it is content of something that should be regarded a table
 logically, i.e. not a table that is a table just for the sake of
 visual page layout. A cell is either suitable for TrueTables (<span
 class="coderef">POSITIVE</span>), unsuitable for TrueTables (<span
 class="coderef">NEGATIVE</span>), or neutral (<span
 class="coderef">NEUTRAL</span>). Numeric text content will increase
 the likelihood of a cell becoming suitable for TrueTables. Other text
 and replaced content will decrease it. Cells with colspan != 1 are
 always neutral. Numeric text content is words that start with a
 digit, '+', ',', '-', '.', '/', ':', ';' or '%'.</p>

 <p>Exact algorithm: Cells and non-replaced blocks keep track of the
 number of how many lines or child blocks or tables that should
 contribute positively to TrueTable detection, and how many of them
 should contribute negatively. Neutral lines or child blocks are not
 counted. The detection algorithm works recursively.</p>

 <p>A positive line is a line whose width comprises two thirds or more
 of numeric text content (and one third or less of other text content,
 margins, border, padding, replaced content, inline-blocks and
 inline-tables). The remaining lines are negative, except for the ones
 that have no content at all. Such lines are neutral.</p>

 <p>A positive block is an in-flow, non-replaced block which has more
 positive than negative lines, in-flow blocks or tables. The remaining
 in-flow blocks are negative, except for the ones that consist of only
 one negative line, and the maximum width of that line is less than
 2em. Such blocks are neutral.</p>

 <p>A table is positive if it is an in-flow, block level table that
 was found to be a TrueTable or SmallTable. In-flow, block level
 tables found NOT to be a TrueTable will disable TrueTable and
 SmallTable detection for all ancestor tables (so that they all end up
 being displayed in single columns). Note that NOT being a TrueTable
 includes being a SmallTable in this case.</p>

 <p>Replaced in-flow blocks are negative.</p>

 <p>Absolutely positioned and floated content is neutral.</p>

 <p>The table cell then follows the same algorithm as in-flow,
 non-replaced blocks to find out if it is suitable for TrueTables. It
 propagates the result to its parent table, which will keep track of
 how many cells in each column are suitable or unsuitable for
 TrueTables. The final destiny of the table with regards to TrueTable
 / SmallTable detection will take place when all its cells have been
 laid out. This is described later.</p>

 <h5>Colspanned cells</h5>

 <p>Minimum (and maximum) width of a colspanned cell may never be less
 than 1px more than border-spacing multiplied with one less than the
 columns that it spans, including any <a
 href="#referenced-column">unreferenced columns</a>.</p>

 In other words:

 <blockquote>minimum width >= (colspan - 1) * (horizontal border
 spacing + 1)</blockquote>

 <p>Example: Minimum width of a cell that has a colspan of 50 in a table
 with horizontal border-spacing of 10px must be at least:</p>

 <blockquote>(50-1) * (10px + 1px) = 539px</blockquote>

 <p>If the desired / percentage / minimum / maximum width of a
 colspanned cell exceeds the total already set on the columns that it
 spans, the extra width must be distributed, so that the colspanned
 cell fits. Here is what to do, in the following order (note that, as
 always in automatic table layout, desired width and percentage width
 are mutually exclusive; percentage wins, desired width is
 ignored):</p>

 <table border="1" id="colspan-expand-t">

  <tr>

   <th>width type</th>

   <th>distribution algorithm</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>percentage</td>

   <td>Distribute extra percentage (what's more than already set on
   the columns) across columns that don't yet have any percentage
   set. The larger maximum width, the larger portion of the percentage
   will be given to a column. If there is no maximum width, distribute
   extra percentage evenly on said columns. If all columns already
   have a percentage set, do nothing.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>desired</td>

   <td>Adjust maximum width of the columns that don't have a desired width
   (using extra space). NOTE: Existing desired widths of the columns are not
   changed - that aligns us with all major browsers better. The final widths
   might still then become greater after the <a href="#distribute-space">
   regular column width distribution algorithm</a>.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>normal minimum</td>

   <td>Use <a href="#distribute-space">regular column width
   distribution algorithm</a>. If total percentage on the spanned
   columns exceeds 100, scale them down to a total of 100% instead of
   ignoring excess percentage. Total percentage of all columns in the
   table is irrelevant.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>minimum</td>

   <td>Use <a href="#distribute-space">regular column width
   distribution algorithm</a>. If total percentage on the spanned
   columns exceeds 100, scale them down to a total of 100% instead of
   ignoring excess percentage. Total percentage of all columns in the
   table is irrelevant.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>maximum</td>

   <td>Use <a href="#distribute-space-excess">excess space
   distribution part of regular column width distribution
   algorithm</a>.</td>

  </tr>

 </table>

 <h4><a name="table-minmax">Find total table minimum and maximum widths</a></h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::ComputeMinMaxWidth()</div>

 <p>All cell and column boxes have contributed to the table's column
 array at this point, and based on this information, we can calculate
 the table's minimum and maximum widths, which will be used to
 determine the width of the table, as well as being propagated to
 parents. Table minimum width is the sum of the minimum width of each
 column plus table border, padding, and the border-spacing around each
 <a href="#referenced-column">referenced</a> column. Table maximum
 width is the sum of the maximum width, or the minimum width if it is
 larger, of each column plus table border, padding, and the
 border-spacing around each <a
 href="#referenced-column">referenced</a> column.</p>

 <h5><a name="auto-percent">Percentage columns in auto width tables</a></h5>

 <p>Percents in <a href="#column-array">columns</a> are relative to
 the containing block, which is the table. If the table width is auto,
 the containing block is unknown (auto width on a table doesn't mean
 use width of containing block, but rather a form of shrink-to-fit).
 The table width used will then depend on the column percentage and
 maximum widths. If percentage columns increase the table's maximum
 width, it is important that this increase is not propagated to
 parents. The maximum width <i>CMW</i> of a column with a percentage
 of <i>CP</i> requires that <i>CMW</i> pixels be at most
 <i>CP</i> percent of the maximum width <i>TMW</i> of the table:</p>

 <blockquote>CMW <= TMW * CP / 100</blockquote>

 <p>or:</p>

 <blockquote>TMW >= CMW * 100 / CP</blockquote>

 <p>Example: A 25% wide column with a maximum width of 50px requires
 the maximum width of the table to be greater than 50px * 100 / 25 =
 200px.</p>

 <p>Details: Iterate over all columns and add the total maximum width
 of all non-percent based columns <i>NPW</i> together. This will serve
 as a base for a table maximum width that takes percentages into
 account.<br> The highest allowed total percentage <i>TP</i> for all
 columns is 100. Cope with excess percentage by truncating the
 percentage of the column that causes the total to exceed 100, so that
 the total becomes 100 nevertheless. Ignore percentage on remaining
 columns with percentage set, but find the highest maximum width value
 among them <i>IMW</i>. It may have to serve as fallback base for new
 table maximum width.</p>

 <p>Done with column iteration. Next step: If <i>NPW</i> is non-zero,
 pretend that this is the width of the &quot;unclaimed
 percentage&quot; in the table (100-<i>TP</i> percent, in other
 words). To be able to satisfy the percentage on the columns with no
 percentage set, table maximum width must be at least:</p>

 <blockquote>NPW * 100 / (100 - TP)</blockquote>

 <p>If <i>TP</i> is 100 here, table maximum width becomes infinity
 (since no table width can satisfy percentage widths then). If
 <i>NPW</i> is 0, but <i>IMW</i> isn't, <i>IMW</i> is used as a
 fallback: Pretend that <i>IMW</i> represents 1% of the table maximum
 width; in other words, make sure that table maximum width is
 <i>IMW</i> * 100 or more. <span class="consider">Is this an important
 feature in IE worth copying, or is it just a bug?</span> We now have
 a maximum width that is large enough to satisfy percentage widths,
 and at the same time keep cell content of non-percentage columns from
 wrapping. What remains is to make sure that the maximum width is
 large enough to keep cell content of each percentage column from
 wrapping as well. For each percent-based column, make sure that table
 maximum width is at least:</p>

 <blockquote>CMW * 100 / CP</blockquote>

 <p>where CMW is the column's maximum width and CP is the column's
 percentage value. We assume that percentage total is 100 in this
 step, instead of using the actual value.</p>

 <p><span class="consider">Firefox behaves differently here: it uses
 the smallest, not the largest, percentage value set on a cell in the
 <a href="#column-array">column array</a>. This may result in a larger
 a table maximum width. It seems like a logical thing to do, but
 currently, neither Opera nor IE do this.</span></p>

 <h5>Tables with no columns</h5>

 <p>A table with no columns (i.e. no cell or column boxes) uses the
 largest minimum and maximum widths of any captions in the table as
 its minimum and maximum width.</p>

 <h4>Request reflow</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::UpdateScreen()</div>

 <p>Minimum and maximum width of the table and all its <a
 href="#column-array">columns</a> have been determined. Now we need
 another reflow to lay out table cells with their correct width. They
 can get their correct width in the second pass because the <a
 href="#column-array">column</a> widths can be calculated. The column
 widths can be calculated because the <a href="#minmax">minimum and
 maximum</a> widths of the table have been found.</p>

 <h4>Detect TrueTable / SmallTable (ERA)</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::FinishLayout()</div>

 <p>This section only applies if TrueTables are enabled in the current
 rendering mode, which is typically the case in CSSR.</p>

 <p>In CSSR mode, most tables will be displayed in a single column,
 since available width is very limited, so that columns would become
 uselessly narrow otherwise. However, in some cases we want to display
 a table as a regular table - when the table is found to be a "real
 table" (as opposed to a table used to get some desired layout)
 (TrueTable), or when the table's maximum width is small enough to fit
 within the containing block (SmallTable). There is very little
 difference between TrueTables and SmallTables, apart from the way
 they are detected.</p>

 <p>Each cell in the table has already been examined (<span
 class="coderef">enum TRUE_TABLE_CANDIDATE</span>), and have been
 found to be either suitable for TrueTables (<span
 class="coderef">POSITIVE</span>), unsuitable for TrueTables (<span
 class="coderef">NEGATIVE</span>), or neutral (<span
 class="coderef">NEUTRAL</span>).</p>

 <p>Now each column will be examined. If the column has more suitable
 than unsuitable cells for TrueTable, the column is defined as
 suitable for TrueTable. If the column has fewer suitable than
 unsuitable cells for TrueTable, the column is defined as unsuitable
 for TrueTable. If the column has the same number of suitable as
 unsuitable cells for TrueTable, the column is neutral.</p>

 <p>If there are any columns suitable for TrueTable, and that number
 is at least twice as many as the number of unsuitable columns for
 TrueTable, then the table becomes a TrueTable.</p>

 <p>If the table did not become a TrueTable, but its maximum width
 does not exceed available width for the table, the table is a
 SmallTable.</p>

 <p>If the table is neither a TrueTable nor a SmallTable (and
 TrueTables are enabled in the current rendering mode), the table will
 be displayed in a single column.</p>

 <h3><a name="pass-2">Final layout pass</a></h3>

 <p>In the final layout pass, minimum and maximum widths of the table
 and each of its columns are known, and layout of table boxes with
 their final and correct width can be done. When a table box has
 already been laid out, but needs a reflow because its containing
 block width has changed, it will skip directly to this second layout
 pass, since minimum and maximum widths are not affected by containing
 block width changes.</p>

 <h4>Calculate table width</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::CalculateTableWidth()</div>

 <p>A table will be at least as wide as its minimum width. <a
 href="#minmax">Desired or percentage</a> table width is honored if it
 exceeds the minimum width of the table. If no desired width is
 specified, use the smaller of table maximum width and table
 containing block width as table width.</p>

 In other words - if desired or percentage width is specified:

 <blockquote>table width = MAX(desired width, minimum
 width)</blockquote>

 If no desired or percentage width is specified:

 <blockquote>table width = MIN(MAX(minimum width, containing block
 width), maximum width)</blockquote>

 <h4>Calculate column widths</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::CalculateColumnWidths()</div>

 <p>Distribute available width - table width without padding, border
 and border-spacing across the <a
 href="#column-array">columns</a>.</p>

 <h5>Single column mode</h5>

 <p>If the table is in single column mode (ERA), all column widths
 will simply be set to the available table width (they are going to be
 laid out on separate lines anyway). Single column mode is used when
 explicitly enabled for the rendering mode, or if TrueTables are
 enabled (typically SSR and CSSR) and this table was found not to be a
 TrueTable or SmallTable.</p>

 <h5>Flexible columns</h5>

 <p>If flexible columns are enabled for the rendering mode (typically
 all ERA modes but MSR), it will apply as long as the table was found
 not to be a SmallTable (if it is a SmallTable, all column maximum
 widths can be satisfied anyway). If it applies, a table row is
 allowed to wrap if the total <i>minimum width</i> of the columns
 exceeds available width. If this happens, satisfy <i>minimum
 width</i> of each column (starting at the first column in the table),
 as long as the total width doesn't exceed available width. If there
 is unsatisfied <i>normal minimum width</i> for the columns examined
 so far, distribute as much of it as possible (exactly how will be
 described in a later version of this document). Then wrap to a new
 "row" and repeat what was just done for the previous "row", for as
 many columns as there are room for. Repeat this as long as there are
 columns left to examine.</p>

 <p>If the rows don't wrap, use the following width distribution
 algorithm, just as in normal layout mode:</p>

 <h5>Regular width distribution</h5>

 <p>This algorithm is described in detail in the <a
 href="#distribute-space">regular column width distribution
 algorithm</a> chapter. In short, step by step: start by satisfying
 minimum widths of each column. If there is more space left, satisfy
 percentage column widths. If there is more space left, satisfy
 desired width. If there is enough space left to satisfy maximum
 widths of each column with no desired or percentage width, do
 that. If there is more space left after this, distribute it all by
 stretching each column with no desired or percentage width relative
 to their maximum width. If there are no such columns, stretch columns
 with desired width with non-zero minimum width. If there are no such
 columns, stretch columns with percentage width with non-zero minimum
 width. If there are no such columns, all columns have zero minimum
 width. Stretch all columns relative to their desired width. If no
 columns have a desired width, stretch all columns evenly.</p>

 <h4>Lay out every column and cell box</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableCellBox::Layout(),
 TableContent::UpdateColumnWidths()</div>

 <p>Here we go again... However, this time we know the actual size of
 the <a href="#column-array">columns</a>, so calculating cell widths
 is possible. The border-box of a cell is the same as the total width
 of the column(s) that it spans, plus any border-spacing between each
 column.</p>

 <h4>Check if reflow is needed</h4>

 <div class="coderef">TableContent::UpdateScreen()</div>

 <p>If any minimum or maximum widths changed during this layout pass,
 we need another reflow, since such changes may affect <a
 href="#column-array">column</a> widths.</p>

 <h2><a name="referenced-column">Definition of 'referenced column'</a></h2>

 <p>A column that is the first column for at least one cell box is
 defined as <i>referenced</i>. Colspan &gt; 1 and excess column boxes
 may cause <i>unreferenced</i> columns - columns in which no cell
 starts.</p>

 <p>Consider the following example:</p>

 <pre class="code">
&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;this cell should use all available table space&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td colspan=&quot;5&quot;&gt;even if this cell spans 4 more columns&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>

<p>This table has 5 columns. Only 1 of them is <i>referenced</i> (by 2
cells). The remaining 4 are <i>unreferenced</i>.</p>

<p>Another example, but defining excess column boxes instead of using
colspan:</p>

 <pre class="code">
&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;col&gt;&lt;/col&gt;
 &lt;col&gt;&lt;/col&gt;
 &lt;col&gt;&lt;/col&gt;
 &lt;col&gt;&lt;/col&gt;
 &lt;col&gt;&lt;/col&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;these two cells combined&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;should use all available table space&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>

 <p>There are 5 column boxes, but only the 2 first ones are
 <i>referenced</i>.</p>

 <p>Unreferenced columns don't take up any space. Border-spacing
 between them is distributed among referenced columns.</p>

 <p>The concept of referencedness is not defined in the HTML spec
 (which simply says that all columns contribute to table width, but it
 does mention that it is an error if the number of referenced columns
 do not equal the number of columns defined by COL/COLGROUP, if
 any). However, both MSIE and Firefox have this concept.
 Konqueror/Safari has to, albeit somewhat &quot;buggy&quot;.</p>

 <h2><a name="distribute-space">Column width distribution algorithm</a></h2>

 <div class="coderef">ColumnCalculation,
 TableContent::DistributeSpace()</div>

 <p>Here is the complete step-by-step description of the width
 distribution algorithm to use when distributing width across a
 certain set of columns. It is used when setting all column widths
 based on final table width. It is also used expanding column minimum,
 normal minimum or maximum widths due to colspan.</p>

 <p>Desired width and percentage width are mutually exclusive in this
 algorithm; if both are set on a column, desired width is ignored.</p>

 <p><b>Algorithm input:</b> Column selection; start column and number
 of columns. Minimum total number of pixels to occupy by the selected
 columns (also called <i>available space</i> or
 <i>available width</i>). Minimum width, maximum width, desired width,
 percentage width of each selected column</p>

 <p><b>Algorithm output:</b> New width of each selected column. The
 sum of the selected columns' widths must be equal to available
 width.</p>

 <h3>Check percentage</h3>

 <p>Sanity check and correction of percentage widths:</p>
 <p><b>For automatic table layout:</b> Make sure that
 the percentage width of all columns combined doesn't exceed 100, and
 adjust values if necessary: Start with the first column and
 accumulate percentage values for each column. If the number exceeds
 100 at a column, truncate that column's percentage value so that the
 <i>total percentage</i> becomes 100. Remove percentage values from
 all remaining columns.</p>
 <p><b>For fixed table layout:</b> If the percentage width of all columns
 exceeds 100, reduce the percentage of each column proportionally, so that
 the sum will become exactly 100.</p>

 <p>This is only done when calculating all columns of a table, not
 when expanding column min/max widths due to colspan. In that case,
 percentages are scaled down to sum 100% (only the columns selected
 are considered).</p>

 <h3>Set start width</h3>

 <p>When setting final column widths based on table widths, or when
 expanding columns' minimum widths due to colspan, start by setting
 each column width to its minimum width. When expanding normal minimum
 width due to colspan, start by setting each column to its normal
 minimum width instead. When expanding maximum width due to colspan,
 start by setting each column to its maximum width.</p>

 <p>The widths may only be increased after this step; they will never
 shrink.</p>

 <p>When expanding maximum width due to colspan, skip to the step
 where excess space is distributed now. This is necessary because what
 many of the following steps attempt to do has already been
 achieved.</p>

 <h3>[ERA] Attempt to satisfy normal minimum widths</h3>

 <p>This part only relevant when when column start width is minimum
 width.</p>

 <p>If there is space left to distribute at this point, and layout
 mode is non-normal (ERA, AMSR, CSSR, etc.), attempt to increase
 column widths from minimum width to &quot;normal minimum
 width&quot;. Columns should really only be narrower than normal
 minimum width if absolutely inevitable, so regaining this space is
 first priority. If there is enough space to satisfy normal minimum
 width of each column completely, just do that. Otherwise, distribute
 extra space by giving more to columns with larger difference between
 minimum width and normal minimum width.</p>

 <h3>Attempt to satisfy percentage widths</h3>

 <p>If there is still space left to distribute, widen each
 percentage-based column to satisfy their percentage
 setting. Percentages are relative to <i>available space</i>, unless
 total minimum width of non-percentage columns constitute a larger
 portion of the table than the unused percentage:</p>

 <blockquote>non-percentage columns' minimum widths > (100 - total
 percentage) * available width</blockquote>

 <p>If this is true, column percentages are scaled down so that new
 total percentage multiplied with space left equals the difference
 between <i>available space</i> and non-percentage columns' minimum
 widths. Also, if there are only percentage columns in the table,
 percentage values are scaled up so that summed they become
 100%.</p>

 <p>Columns whose percentage resolves to a width less than their
 minimum width count as non-percentage columns in this
 step. Otherwise, more space than available might be distributed.</p>

 <h3>Attempt to satisfy desired widths</h3>

 <p>If there is still space left, attempt to satisfy the desired width
 of each column. If there is enough space to satisfy them all
 completely, just do that. Otherwise, increase the width of each
 unsatisfied column to the difference between current width and
 desired width scaled down so that complete increase equals amount of
 space left.</p>

 <h3>Attempt to satisfy maximum widths</h3>

 <p>If there is still space left, attempt to satisfy the maximum width
 of each column width no desired nor percentage width. If this would
 use more space than available, make no changes and skip to the next
 step in this algorithm.</p>

 <h3><a name="distribute-space-excess">Excess space - distribute any
 remaining space</a></h3>

 <p>If there is still space left, find one set of columns that have
 certain characteristics (presence of desired width, minimum width,
 percentage) in common, and assign ALL remaining space to them. There
 are four types of sets, and here is the list, in order of preference,
 and how remaining space is distributed for them:</p>

 <table border="1">
  <col width="50%"></col>
  <col width="50%"></col>

  <tr>

   <th>Condition (column set characteristics)</th>

   <th>Action (distribution method)</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>columns with auto (no percentage AND no desired) width AND
   non-zero minimum width<br><br>

   Note: In quirks mode, if a <a href="#column-array">column's</a>
   maximum width exceeds desired width, desired width is ignored (and
   the column behaves as if it had auto width). <span
   class="consider">IE always ignores desired width exceeded by
   maximum width, while Opera, Konqueror and Firefox only do that in
   quirks mode</span></td>

   <td>widen each column relative to its unsatisfied maximum width
   (difference between width so far and maximum width)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>columns with desired width (and no percentage)</td>

   <td>widen each column by the larger of each column's minimum width
   and desired width relative to the sum of total of the larger of
   desired width and minimum width of each column</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>columns with percentage</td>

   <td>widen each column relative to their percentage</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>all columns</td>

   <td>widen each column relative to their maximum width, or, if none
   has maximum width, distribute remaining space evenly</td>

  </tr>
 </table>
