<h2>Detailed documentation</h2>

<h3>Layout basics</h3>

<h4>Box & content model</h4>

The layout tree is primarily constructed of two element types,
Box and Content elements.  Box elements serve to position an
element on the page, and usually has a content element associated
with it.  Content elements in turn handle the contents of the
boxes, such as images, select boxes, etc.

<h4>Cascade</h4>

<p>This is an implementation of the CSS cascade.  It's a simple
linked list that ends in the CSS properties of the current element,
with the CSS properties of its parents preceding it.

<h4>Reflow</h4>

<p>Reflow does the actual job of constructing the layout tree from
the DOM tree.  Reflow is performed every time an element in the DOM
tree is marked dirty.  As soon as an element is marked dirty, the
layout tree cannot be accessed before the reflow has completed.

<p>It may take several reflow iterations before the DOM tree
can be marked clean, but under most conditions, one iteration should
be sufficient.

<h4>Traversal</h4>

<p>In order to access the layout tree, traversal objects are used.

<p>TraversalObject
<p>Block traverse
<p>Line traverse
<p>Z-index traverse

<h3>Layout details</h3>

<h4>Floats</h4>

<h4>Broken HTML</h4>

<p>This code
<pre>
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;one&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;two
</pre>

Generates this tree
<pre>
  P(1)
   |
   v
  FONT
  |   \
  v    v
"one" P(2)
       |
       v
     "two"
</pre>

<p>p(1)->last_descendant is now set to "one".  "one" is thus the last element to inherit CSS
properties from p(1).  The is_last_descendant flag is also set on "one". When we have reached
"one", we need to recalculate the cascade.</p>


<h5>Cascading props</h5>
Some complications to the broken HTML rendering:

(never mind that &lt;/P&gt; is not mandatory and other technical details.)

&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/div&gttext2

<pre>
BODY
 |
 v
 P border:10px solid red;
 |
 v
DIV border:inherit;
 |     \
 v      v
text    text2
</pre>

text2 will inherit from LayoutProperties::cascading_props, but the actual props of DIV is not changed when recalculating the cascade. Otherwise we could end up with an incomplete/weird border (or in worst case a box that changes from e.g. block to inline).



<h4>Table layout</h4>
	<h5>Fixed table layout</h5>

	<p>Fixed layout is described in the <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#fixed-table-layout">CSS
	spec</a>. Opera implementation detail: If width is auto, Opera
	will fall back to automatic table layout.</p>

	<h5>Automatic table layout</h5>

	<p>Automatic table layout is not well defined in the CSS
	spec. The algorithm used in Opera is described <a
	href="tables.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Shrink to fit</h4>
<p>
<a href ="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins">CSS 2.1 calculating widths and margins<a>
</p>

<p>A ShrinkToFitContainer is created when an element is not replaced,
  has width:auto, either "left" or "right" is auto and it
  is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">absolutely/fixed
  positioned</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#q12">has
  display:inline-block</a>,
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#q8">floated</a>, or
  if the element type is &lt;BUTTON&gt;. To calculate a suitable width
  for a ShrinkToFitContainer, we employ
  the <a href="minmax.html">min/max width calculation and propagation
  algorithm</a>. This algorithm is also used to calculate the
  scrolling content width for horizontal &lt;MARQUEE&gt;s. It is also
  used to calculate suitable column and table widths
  in <a href="tables.html">automatic table layout</a>.</p>

 <p>Shrink-to-fit basically means that the container will not be wider
   than the unbroken content of the container, and not wider than the
   available width, but it must never be narrower than the minimum
   width (longest word).<p>

<h4>Margin collapsing</h4>

<p>First of all, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#box-dimensions">CSS Box Dimensions</a> for explanation what margin is.</p>
<p>
We say that two margins are adjoining when there is no non-empty content, padding or border areas or clearance separate them. It is possible that one element's own top and bottom margins are adjoining.<br>
Collapsing margins means that adjoining margins of two or more boxes (which may be next to one another or nested) combine to form a single margin.
</p>

<h5>Margin collapsing algorithm</h5>
<p>
Margins are calculated during reflow. There are however cases where layout engine reflows document tree only partially by omitting some branches. In this case we trigger margin calculation "manually" on omitted content as such margin may still affect ancestor being reflowed. Many of "margin collapsing bugs" are caused by differences in margin calculation between "full reflow" and "partial reflow" cases.
<p>
Opera margin calculation algorithm is mostly based on container's <code>reflow_state->margin_state</code>. This variable defines an offset that will be added to next laid out child top position. <code>reflow_state->margin_state</code> can be changed by either child's top or bottom margin. There are also two helpers: <code>packed.stop_top_margin_collapsing</code> and <code>reflow_state->stop_bottom_margin_collapsing</code> that control whether calculated <code>reflow_state->margin_state</code> should be propagated to parent.
</p>

<p>
Here we have some examples of adjoining and collapsing margins. <i>outer</i> div will be treated as an element where we start layout. It has borders so we don't have to take care of margin collapsing/propagation to it's parents. For simplicity we will assume that we have only positive (non-percentage) margins.

When <i>child_1</i>'s layout is being finished, it's bottom margin <i>k</i> is being propagated. Because <i>parent_1</i> has top padding set <i>child_1</i>'s margin sets <i>parent_1</i>'s <code>margin_state</code>. When <i>parent_1</i>'s layout is being finished it's bottom margin <i>m</i> collapses with current
<i>parent_1</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> and such value is assigned (not collapsed with!) to <i>outer</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> (this automatically becomes top margin of <i>parent_2</i> when it comes to it's layout). When <i>parent_2</i> is being laid out it originally uses current <i>outer</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> to determine it's vertical position. Later it's top margin <i>l</i> collapses with <i>outer</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> (this may push <i>parent_2</i> down if <i>l</i> was bigger then pre-calculated <i>outer</i>'s <code>margin_state</code>).</p>

<p> Notice that <i>child_1</i>'s bottom margin does not change <i>parent_1</i>'s height. It kind of flows outside <i>parent_1</i> modifying <i>parent_1</i>'s bottom margin. If only <i>parent_1</i> had a bottom border or padding, <i>child_1</i>'s bottom margin could not be propagated and <i>parent_1</i>'s height would be increased accordingly to current <i>parent_1</i>'s <code>margin_state</code>.</p>

<p>This is also a case when partial layout may trigger "on demand" margin calculation. If we trigger <i>child_2</i>'s reflow, layout will be limited to branch holding element that actually needs a layout. This means that <i>parent_1</i>'s layout will be started but it's content will not be reflowed (as nothing needs reflow there). This means that <i>child_1</i>'s bottom margin <i>k</i> will not get propagated. Therefore we trigger a procedure that calculates bottom margin that equals to <i>parent_1</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> as it would be after full layout pass over all of it's children. It is then propagated to <i>outer</i> modifying it's <code>margin_state</code> Of course, this would not happen when <i>parent_1</i> had a bottom border or padding. Only <i>parent_1</i>'s own bottom margin would be propagated then.</p>

<p>"On demand" bottom margin calculation procedure collapses all adjoining margins it finds starting with last element on a container's layout stack and moving up through it.</p>

There are some exception from above margin collapsing rules (according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">CSS2 Margin Collapsing spec</a>):
<ol>
<li>Vertical margins between a floated box and any other box do not collapse (not even between a float and its in-flow children).</li>
<li>Vertical margins of elements that establish new block formatting contexts (such as floats and elements with 'overflow' other than 'visible') do not collapse with their in-flow children.</li>
<li>Margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse (not even with their in-flow children).</li>
<li>Margins of inline-block elements do not collapse (not even with their in-flow children).</li>
<li>An element that has had clearance applied to it never collapses its top margin with its parent block's bottom margin.</li>

		This is pretty simple case. Absolutely positioned box is handled separately therefore there is no margin collapsing. However,
		due to our traversal engine some extra actions need to be taken in order to ensure that <i>abs</i> element is positioned correctly.
		Basically when traversing layout tree, each time we enter child element translation gets updated by adding element's (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)
		position (which is relative to parent's border edge). This affects absolutely positioned boxes as well so we need to be careful when
		collapsing margins after absolutely positioned box was laid out.
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>abs</i> is absolutely positioned therefore there is no margin collapsing. When laying out <i>abs</i> there is no margin between
		<i>outer</i> (which is <i>abs</i>'s containing block) and <i>inner</i> (<b>*</b>) and therefore <i>abs</i>'s absolute top offset is 0.

		Later, <i>abs_sibling</i> propagates it's top margin but since <i>inner</i> element does not stop top margin propagation,
		<i>abs_sibling</i>'s top margin gets propagated up to <i>outer</i> and causes <i>inner</i> to be pushed down by <i>n</i> px.
		Now, unlike to (<b>*</b>) case there is a margin between <i>outer</i> and <i>inner</i>. Since <i>abs</i> screen position needs to remain
		constant we need to shift it up by <i>n</i> pixels basically compensating for margin that will be added to translation when
		we will be traversing such tree. There are however some corner cases when partial reflow causes <i>abs</i> top offset to be decreased forever.
		Those issues are being tracked by <a href="https://bugs.opera.com/browse/CORE-19567">CORE-19567</a> and <a href="https://bugs.opera.com/browse/CORE-17858">CORE-17858</a>.

		This is pretty simple case. It may sound weird as collapsing child's top margin with parent's bottom margin seems impossible. However
		(as shown in A-D cases) we do not differentiate between top &amp; bottom margin. Parent's <code>margin_state</code> simply keeps current top margin for next element
		to be laid out (and this may be set by a top margin of empty child element as well as may be result of some margin collapsing).
		When parent's layout is finished and <code>margin_state</code> in non-zero it may be collapsed with
		parent's own bottom margin resulting in child's top margin being collapsed with parent's bottom margin.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this example <i>cleared</i> element set's <i>inner</i>'s <code>margin_state</code> to <i>m</i> px. (if <i>inner</i> have had bottom margin it would have been collapsed with it's top margin).
		When it comes to closing <i>inner</i>'s layout we must be aware that current <code>margin_state</code> was set by child with clearance and therefore this margin should not be collapsed with
		<i>inner</i>'s own bottom margin <i>k</i>. Finally, <i>inner</i>'s height will be <span style="white-space:nowrap"><i>l</i> + <i>m</i></span> and it will have bottom margin of <i>m</i> px.

<h4>BiDi</h4>
<p>
<a href ="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode BiDi specification</a>
</p>
<p>Bidi operates both in the layout pass and in the line traverse.</p>

<p>In the layout pass, levels for each segment are calculated according to the rules in the bidi specification. The level for the segment describes how many times each segment should be turned around. For example a segment of level 2 should be turned around twice, <u>along with all its higher level containing segments</u>.</p>

<p>Level calculation is done on a per paragraph level.</p>

<p>Reordering of segments is done on a per-line basis (all according to the bidi spec). The reordering is done in the line traverse pass for each entered Line. The segments are painted in logical order, but with offsets on the line calculated from the reordering.</p>



<h4>ERA</h4>

<p>
<a href = "http://qa.oslo.opera.com/projects/core/era/spec/eraspec.html">ERA specification</a>
</p>

<h4>Text wrap</h4>

Text wrap is a rendering mode / feature where regular
lines may not be wider than the browser window. Text using large fonts
is exempted. Line breaking caused by &quot;Text wrap&quot; will only
happen at places where the current line breaking
properties allow it (meaning that text with white-space:nowrap will
not be wrapped because of this feature. This feature reduces the need
for horizontal scrolling while reading text paragraphs in a
constrained screen width environment.

<p><a href = "text_wrap.html">Further specification of text wrap</a>

<h4>FlexRoot</h4>

<p>FlexRoot is documented <a href="flexroot.html">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Page breaking</h4>
<p>
<a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html">CSS 2.1 page breaking specification</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-page-20040225/">CSS 3 paged media module (20040225 draft)</a>
</p>

<p>When page breaking is on, after closing a vertical layout (Line, block...) we record the <a href = "http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html#break-inside">widows and orphans</a> state of the current vertical layout. We will also to find out if this vertical layout has overflowed the current page. If it has overflowed the page we will attempt to find a page break.
</p>

<p>During a page breaking reflow, when closing a VerticalLayout we will also update the reflow_state->reflow_position. If the closed VerticalLayout has a page break after, we will move the current reflow_position to the start of the next page. This will ensure that the next element is laid out on the next page. (Container::SkipPageBreaks)</p>

<p>We will now iterate from the last (current) element in the Container:s vertical_layout stack upwards to find the first element whose top position is on the previous page.
</p>

<p>If the found element is a block (with container/table/... content) we will first enter the block and attempt the page break inside that block  (restart from above). If that fails we will insert a PendingBreakBreak before this element.
</p>

<p>If the found element is a Line and its bottom is on the next page, and the widows/orphans constraint is satisfied we will insert a pending page break element before this element.
</p>

<p>If page breaking in this container fails, we will go to the parent element and try to insert the page break in this element. If that also fails we will loosen the constraints and retry page breaking.</p>

<p>After inserting the pending page break, we turn page breaking off for the rest of the reflow (for optimization). But we now need to restart page breaking from the inserted page break. We do this by setting the page break element in LayoutWorkplace. Next time the layout tree is clean, we will initiate a PAGEBREAK_FIND reflow.</p>

<p>The PAGEBREAK_FIND reflow will reflow up to the container containing the PendingPageBreak and convert the PendingPageBreak into an ImplicitPageBreak. After this is done we will continue with page breaking from this place.</p>

<p>If two (or more) elements that should both be broken lie beside each other (floats, table cells, abs pos boxes), page breaking will be rewound to restart page breaking of the other box in BlockBox::FinishLayout.</p>

<h5>Relevant variables</h5>

<dl>
<dt><code>ContainerReflowState::is_css_first_line</code></dt>
<dd>TRUE If this element has a ::first-line pseudo-element and the currently reflowing line is the first line. See also <code>Container::IsCssFirstLine()</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>Line::packed2.is_first_line</code></dt>
<dd>Set if this is the first line in a container and affected by a ::first-line rule.</dd>

<dt><code>WordInfo::packed2.first_line_width</code></dt>
<dd>Set if the word width is calculated with ::first-line in regard.</dd>

<dt><code>Text_Box::packed.first_line_word_spacing</code></dt>
<dd>The width of space for text painted with ::first-line properties.</dd>

<dt><code>HTML_Element::packed2.has_first_line</code></dt>
<dd>Set if this element is affected by a ::first-line rule.</dd>

<dt><code>LayoutProperties::use_first_line_props</code></dt>
<dd>This variable is used to track if we are currently in a branch where ::first-line properties are applied. At the time of writing this is only used for a dubious workaround when reflowing children of a ::first-line element with the content: property set. I think the correct solutions would be to make sure that cascading_props for the parent (the first-line version of the element) also gets content_cp set when loading the props.</dd>

<dt><code>g_anonymous_first_line_elm</code></dt>
<dd>A dummy element used to load CSS properties for the first line. This element is only present in the tree when the properties are loaded and computed and removed immediately after.</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Cascade</h5>

<p>Adding first line properties to the cascade is done by calling <code>LayoutProperties::AddFirstLineProperties</code> on the current cascade element. This will create the alternative props for the first line and copy them over to <code>LayoutProperties::cascading_properties</code>. Correspondingly <code>LayoutProperties::RemoveFirstLineProperties</code> is called when handling of the first line is done.

<h5>Layout/Reflow</h5>

<p>For a container with ::first-line we need to lay out contents of the same container with two different sets of properties.

<p>When we lay out a container, and we notice that the element that represents the container has a ::first-line rule, we start by adding the ::first-line properties. (We are obviously starting with reflowing the first line in the container).

<p>We then lay out children of the container. But, as soon as we notice that one of the children overflows a line for example through <code>Container::CommitLineContent</code>, <code>BlockBox::Layout</code>, etc, we return the layout status <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code>. This is propagated to the container until it reaches <code>Container::LayoutWithFirstLine</code>.

<p>We re-use the <code>ContainerReflowState::break_before_content</code> variable to propagate information about where the container should restart laying out. Before propagating the <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code> signal we need to make sure that <code>ContainterReflowState::break_before_content</code> is set to the start element of the next line (or other <code>VerticalLayout</code>). If the line was closed by a block box or a &lt;br&gt; element, we simply set <code>break_before_content</code> to that element. If the line was closed by text or other inline content, we return from <code>Container::CommitLineContent</code> before resetting <code>break_before_content</code>. It will then hold the start element of the next line.

<p>When we receive the <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code> signal in <code>Container::LayoutWithFirstLine</code>, we restart laying out children of the container with <code>ContainerReflowState::break_before_content</code> as the first_child to lay out and the position on the virtual line we were laying out before the <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code> signal as the first virtual position to lay out. This is to make sure that we don't lay out elements or parts of elements that were already laid out on the first line.

<p>It is also possible that a call to <code>::FinishLayout</code> will return a <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code> status. This is handled in a similar way as in <code>Container::LayoutWithFirstLine</code>. When a <code>LAYOUT_END_FIRST_LINE</code> status is received in a child of a ::first-line container, <code>Container::EndFirstLine</code> is called. This function takes care of restarting layout of the container's children, much in the same way as <code>Container::LayoutWithFirstLine</code>.


<h5>Traverse</h5>

<p>::first-line handling during traversal is done in <code>Container::Traverse</code>, and is in this stage a rather simple operation since we have already divided content into lines.

<p>For the first line in a container that is a ::first-line container, <code>LayoutProperties::AddFirstLineProperties</code> is called before entering the first line. After traversal of the first line is done we call <code>LayoutProperties::RemoveFirstLineProperties</code>.

<p>In addition to that, a workaround is required for the cases when the ::first-line rule sets properties on the container that are usually handled in <code>::EnterVerticalBox</code>. An example of that is background-color, which is handled in <code>PaintObject::EnterLine</code>.


<h4>Optimizations</h4>
Important optimizations that needs to be taken in to account and should not be ruined.

<h4>Selection</h4>

Currently there are two representations of selection points in Core:
<code>SelectionBoundaryPoint</code> (defined in logdoc) and a representation used internally
by layout (which is <code>LayoutSelectionPoint</code> as well as various
<code>element</code> + <code>offset</code> value pairs used internally).

<dl>
<dt>LayoutSelectionPoint
<dd>Represents a selection point in the document as an <code>element</code> +
<code>offset</code> pair. If the <code>element</code> is a text node,
<code>offset</code> is a character offset within the text. Otherwise <code>offset</code> is
either <code>0</code> (selection point before the
element) or <code>1</code> (selection point after the element).
<dt>LayoutSelectionPointExtended
<dd>Represents a selection point in the document. In addition to the document
position it also provides information about the word the selection is on and
offset into that word. Internally it also performs translation between the
<code>LayoutSelectionPoint</code> and <code>SelectionBoundaryPoint</code>
representations.
<dt>TextSelection (defined in logdoc)
<dd><code>TextSelection</code> holds information about the current selection. It has two <code>SelectionBoundaryPoint</code>s as members: a start and an end point.
<dt>TextSelectionObject
<dd>The <code>TextSelectionObject</code> is a <code>TraversalObject</code> responsible of translating from a mouse coordinate to <code>SelectionBoundaryPoint</code> (see <code>GetNearestBoundaryPoint()</code>).
<dt>SelectionUpdateObject
<dd>The <code>SelectionUpdateObject</code> is a <code>TraversalObject</code> responsible for sending the correct Update rects to visual device to keep selection updated properly. It is also now responsible of updating documentedit as well as DOM with information regarding the current selection. The <code>SelectionUpdateObject</code> is also responsible for setting the <code>is_in_selection</code> flag on all <code>HTML_Element*</code> that is inside the selection.

<h4>Adaptive zoom</h4>
<p><a href="adaptive_zoom/azoom_first.html">Documentation for adaptive zoom</a>

<h4>run-in</h4>
An element with display:run-in becomes an inline box if:
<li>the element contains no blocks</li>
and:
<li>the element's next sibling is an in-flow block box (i.e. not floated or absolutely positioned)</li>
Otherwise it becomes a block box.

<p>The layout engine starts by assuming that a run-in is a block box and lays it out like that in a
<code>Container</code> (this container is referred to as element A below). After it has been laid
out, the engine knows whether or not it is a inline run-in candidate (if it contained no blocks, it
typically is). If it isn't, it will remain a block. If it is, on the other hand (and this is what
the remaining part of this section attempts to describe), it will store itself in its
<code>Container</code>'s (element A) <code>reflow_state-&gt;pending_run_in_box</code>. This happens
in <code>BlockBox::FinishLayout()</code>. Now we need to find out if there is a next sibling of the
run-in, and if there is, what kind of box that sibling gets. It needs to be an in-flow block box in
order for the run-in to become an inline.</p>

<p>Rule 1: <code>Container::CloseVerticalLayout()</code> will reset its
<code>reflow_state-&gt;pending_run_in_box</code> - unless it's called because a new block is added
from (<code>GetNewBlockStage1()</code>).</p>

<p>Rule 2: <code>Container::Layout()</code> on an element B that is a child block of
<code>Container</code> A will - if B is really a sibling of the run-in - "steal" and reset
<code>Container</code> A's pending_run_in_box, convert it to an inline box and lay it out as if the
run-in sort of were element B's own child (except that B's properties are not inherited into the
run-in).</p>

<p>This means: If we get from the run-in's <code>BlockBox::FinishLayout()</code> to block B's
<code>Container::Layout()</code> without an intervening reset of A's
<code>reflow_state-&gt;pending_run_in_box</code>, you've got an inline run-in. Well,
probably... but there's one more thing: This is only true if the run-in's parent element also is an
ancestor of B; if it isn't, B isn't really a sibling of the run-in. This check is performed in
<code>Container::LayoutRunIn()</code>.</p>

<h4>Elements inserted by layout</h4>

<p>In some situations the layout engine needs to insert HTML elements
on its own. There are three
categories: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">anonymous
table boxes</a>, the
'<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#propdef-content">content</a>'
property (which is normally specified
on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#before-after-content">::before
and ::after pseudo elements</a>, but in Opera (as specified in CSS 3)
we also support it on any other element),
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-letter">::first-letter</a>.</p>
