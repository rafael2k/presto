 <h2>About this document</h2>

 <p>This is a description of Opera's min/max width calculation and
   propagation algorithm. Min/max width values values are used to
   calculate the width of shrink-to-fit containers, tables and flex
   items.</p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <a name="stf-alg"></a>
 <p>CSS 2.1 briefly describes the shrink-to-fit
   algorithm <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#shrink-to-fit-float">here</a>,
   which refers to how column width calculation is done in automatic
   table layout
   - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#auto-table-layout">here</a>.</p>

 <p>When a layout box has automatic width (width:auto), and the box is
   of such a type that it is not to unconditionally take up all
   available space in its containing block, the shrink-to-fit
   algorithm is used.</p>

 <p>Auto-width regular block boxes will take up all
   available width in their containing block, so shrink-to-fit is not
   to be used there, but for floats, absolutely positioned boxes,
   inline-blocks, tables and BUTTONs, shrink-to-fit will be
   involved.</p>

 <p>The formula itself for calculating the width of a shrink-to-fit
   container is quite simple:</p>

 <pre class="code">
   width = MAX(minimum width, MIN(maximum width, available width))</pre>

 <p>... where <a name="minimum-width"><i>minimum width</i></a> is the
   width of the widest piece of unbreakable content, i.e., roughly
   speaking, how wide the box has to be to avoid horizontal
   overflow.</p>

 <p>... where <a name="maximum-width"><i>maximum width</i></a> is the
   width that the box would have to be to prevent implicit avoidable
   wrapping - i.e. implicit line breaks or implicit float
   clearance.</p>

 <p>... where <a name="available-width"><i>available width</i></a> is
   the width the containing block in which the box lives.</p>

 <p>The complicated part here is to calculate <i>minimum width</i> and
   especially <i>maximum width</i>. This is where Opera applies its
   min/max width calculation and propagation algorithm.</p>

 <p>There is also a variable <i>normal minimum width</i>, which is
   used in ERA mode, where we may allow <i>minimum width</i> to become
   narrower than strictly allowed in the CSS spec. In such
   modes, <i>normal minimum width</i> will be set to the minimum width
   that the content would have had in normal layout mode. For the sake
   of final shrink-to-fit box width calculation, <i>normal minimum
   width</i> is generally ignored. <i>Normal minimum width</i> plays a
   role when we see that we can afford to exceed column minimum widths
   in <a href="tables.html">automatic table layout</a>, though.</p>

 <h2>Terminology confusion</h2>

 <p>The CSS specification defines two properties <i>min-width</i>
   and <i>max-width</i>. These have nothing in particular to do with
   the term min/max width calculation and propagation (although they
   do affect such calculation and propagation). It is hopefully clear
   in this documentation which one is meant. The CSS properties are
   always spelled <i>min-width</i> and <i>max-width</i>. For min/max
   width calculation and propagation, we use terms
   like <i>min/max</i>, <i>minimum width</i> and <i>maximum
   width</i>.</p>

 <h2>Application of the min/max algorithm</h2>

 <h3>Shrink-to-fit containers</h3>

 <p>A shrink-to-fit container is a container which establishes a new
   block formatting context, and it gets its width according to the
   shrink-to-fit algorithm.</p>

 <h3>Tables with auto layout</h3>

 <p>A table with table-layout:auto gets its width according to the
   shrink-to-fit algorithm. Its minimum width is the sum of the
   minimum width of all columns in the table, plus any horizontal
   border-spacing. Its maximum width is the sum of the maximum width
   of all columns in the table, plus any horizontal
   border-spacing. This is a simplification; see
   the <a href="tables.html">table layout</a> documentation for all
   details.</p>

 <h3>Flex items</h3>

 <p>The flex algorithm uses min/max widths on the items in a flex
   container to size and/or position the items.</p>

 <p>In a horizontal flex container, items' minimum widths are used to
   resolve 'min-width:auto'. An item's maximum width is used to
   calculate "flex base size" [1] (the size an item has before
   stretching / shrinking), if 'width' is 'auto'.</p>

 <p>In a vertical flex container, if an item has auto width, its
   minimum and maximum widths are used to find the hypothetical cross
   size [2], which in turn is used to align the items horizontally and
   also calculate the flex line's width.</p>

 <h2>Min/max width calculation</h2>

 <p>Min/max widths are calculated and propagated on the fly and on
   demand, when a box is being laid out. If an ancestor container has
   announced that it needs min/max widths, they will
   be <i>propagated</i> from a descendant box. If this descendant box
   has not already calculated its min/max widths, or if they have been
   invalidated somehow (typically by modifying, adding or removing
   child content), min/max widths must be <i>calculated</i> as
   well.</p>

 <p>A shrink-to-fit container, and table-cell and table-caption, will
   enable min/max width calculation, on itself, and it will also
   enable calculation and propagation on all child content. Inline
   content's min/max widths will be propagated to a virtual line,
   which will be propagated further to the container. Block content's
   min/max widths will be propagated to their container. When min/max
   widths are propagated from content to its container, the min/max
   values are constrained against any fixed values of the following
   properties: <i>width</i>, <i>min-width</i>, <i>max-width</i>.</p>

 <p>Min/max width calculation and propagation does not require an
   additional reflow pass in itself, but if the new min/max widths
   calculated differ from the previous values in such a way that box
   widths change, an additional reflow pass is required. For a new
   shrink-to-fit box that has never calculated its min/max widths, two
   reflow passes are therefore generally necessary, unless we managed
   to guess the correct width in the first reflow pass. If the min/max
   widths are unknown at the time of calculating the width of the box
   (typically in the first reflow pass ever for a box), we guess its
   width to be equal to the width of its containing block. If this
   turns out to be true, only one reflow pass is required on this
   shrink-to-fit box. For tables, we guess that each column will have
   a width of 1000px, which is almost as good a guess as any. A width
   of 1000px represents a typical container width, and the assumption
   is that the layout engine works at optimal efficiency with this
   width (there will not be "too many" lines, and the lines will not
   be "too wide").</p>

 <a name="percent-widths"></a>

 <p>The CSS spec is explicitly unclear about percent based widths
   inside a shrink-to-fit box, but different browsers have <b>sort
   of</b> reached a common way of doing it. Percentual widths, both
   content width, margin width and padding width are ignored when
   calculating and propagating min/max widths. Percentual margins and
   padding are treated as if they were 0. Percentual width is treated
   as if it were auto. The only exception to this is FlexRoot mode,
   which has <a href="flexroot.html#percent-widths">its own way of
   dealing with percentual widths</a>.</p>

 <h3>Basic rules for min/max width calculation</h3>

 <p>Minimum and maximum widths of a box with fixed width is that box's
   fixed width. This rule does not apply to flex items (the flex
   algorithm is allowed to override fixed widths).</p>

 <p>Minimum width among adjacent words (text) and other types of
   inline content is the largest minimum width among all the inline
   content.</p>

 <p>Minimum and maximum width of a word is normally simply the width
   of that word, but in non-normal layout mode or when the CSS property
   <i>overflow-wrap</i> is <i>break-word</i>, minimum width will be the
   width of the widest character in the word.</p>

 <p>The maximum width of adjacent words (text) and other types of
   inline content is the sum of the maximum width of each piece of
   inline content, including the width of any white-space that
   separates them.</p>

 <h3>Floats, and the need for "minimum height"</h3>

 <p>Since floats, line boxes, replaced content, tables, new
   block-formatting-context blocks (with overflow:hidden, for
   instance) are affected by floats, we need to figure out which of
   the floats previously defined in the block formatting context may
   make an impact, in order to calculate the correct <i>maximum
   width</i>. To do this, we need to know the height of every single
   box; but this is not about the actual height calculated by the
   layout engine, but rather the height that each box would get
   if <i>maximum width</i> was satisfied. We call this <i>minimum
   height</i>, since the height that a box gets if all its lines are
   stretched to their maximum (and no floats are cleared because of
   insufficient width) typically will make that box as short as it can
   possibly get.</p>

 <p>The minimum height of a box with fixed height is that box's fixed
   height.</p>

 <p>The minimum height of adjacent words (text) and other types of
   inline content is the height of the hypothetical line that would be
   required to contain all of the content.</p>

 <p>The minimum height of a table is the sum of the minimum height of
   all captions, rows and horizontal border-spacing. The minimum
   height of a table row is the largest minimum height of all cells on
   that row. Fixed height is honored in the same manner as for regular
   layout (i.e. it is sort of treated like the min-height
   property).</p>

 <p>Margins affect minimum height, and follow the normal rules for
   margin collapsing, but percentual margins are ignored (treated as
   0).</p>

 <h3>Minimum and maximum widths and minimum height of replaced content</h3>

 <p>If the content has percentual width, the minimum width is set to
   0, and the maximum width is set to the intrinsic width, regardless
   of percentage.</p>

 <p>If the content has fixed width, minimum and maximum width are set
   to this value. This rule does not apply to flex items (the flex
   algorithm is allowed to override fixed widths); instead we behave
   as if width were auto (in the remaining steps below).</p>

 <p>Otherwise, if the content has fixed height and intrinsic ratio,
   the minimum and maximum widths are resolved from the intrinsic
   ratio.</p>

 <p>Otherwise, if content width is auto, minimum and maximum widths
   are set to the intrinsic width.</p>

 <p>If the content has fixed height, the minimum height is set to this
   value.</p>

 <p>If the content has percentual height but doesn't live inside of a
   container with fixed height, height becomes auto for the purpose of
   calculating minimum height. This is very similar to the very rule
   for
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property">calculating
   the computed height, if specified height is percentual</a>, but is
   actually even stricter, because of percentual margins and
   padding.</p>

 <p>If the content has auto height, intrinsic height is used. If a
   fixed width has been specified and the content has an intrinsic
   ratio, intrinsic height it is scaled against those.</p>

 <h2>Implementation details</h2>

 <p>Min/max width propagation is used for table-cells, table-captions,
   absolutely positioned boxes with auto width, floats with auto
   width, inline-blocks with auto width, BUTTONs with auto width,
   LEGENDs with auto width, replaced elements with ::before and/or
   ::after, internally in MARQUEEs, flex items, and maybe more.</p>

 <p>If the width of a float, absolutely positioned box, inline-block,
   BUTTON, or LEGEND is auto, or if the box is a replaced element with
   ::before and/or ::after, a ShrinkToFitContainer is created. Such
   objects will enable min/max width propagation from its descendants,
   and calculate its width according to
   the <a href="#stf-alg">shrink-to-fit algorithm</a>. After one
   reflow pass (ShrinkToFitContainer::FinishLayout() or
   UpdateScreen()) (when min/max widths from all descendants have been
   propagated), it will re-apply the algorithm and see if the width
   changed. If it changed, another reflow pass is required, and it
   will mark itself dirty from SignalChange().</p>

 <p>A horizontal MARQUEE additionally needs to use the min/max width
   algorithm internally, to calculate a suitable width of the
   scrolling content.</p>

 <p>A table-cell or table-caption will create a Container and enable
   min/max propagation from its descendants. Min/max widths from table
   cells will be propagated further to the table, where an array of
   columns are kept up-to-date with min/max widths. This is described
   in greater detail in the <a href="tables.html">table layout</a>
   documentation. Min/max widths from table captions do not affect the
   size of the actual table, but may be propagated further to ancestor
   content, if that is appropriate.</p>

 <p>Min/max width calculation is always enabled on flex items. The
   parent flex container will use these values to size and position
   the items. They will of course also be propagated further up in the
   ancestry (beyond the flex container), if some ancestor has enabled
   min/max width calculation (so that e.g. a float with an auto-width
   flex container is sized correctly, according to the shrink-to-fit
   algorithm).</p>
