 <h2>Inspiration</h2>

 <p>How to resolve percentage-based height is well defined in CSS 2.1:

 <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property">

  The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the
  generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing
  block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content
  height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the value
  computes to 'auto'. A percentage height on the root element is
  relative to the initial containing block.

 </blockquote>

<p>And:

 <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-height-property">
	Note that the height of the containing block of an absolutely
	positioned element is independent of the size of the element itself,
	and thus a percentage height on such an element can always be
	resolved. However, it may be that the height is not known until
	elements that come later in the document have been processed.
 </blockquote>

<p>How to resolve percentage based heights inside tables is also defined in css 2.1. Unfortunately not as well defined.

<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#height-layout">
Percentage heights on table cells, table rows, and table row groups compute to 'auto'.
</blockquote>

<p>And:

<blockquote cite ="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#height-layout">
CSS 2.1 does not define what percentage values of 'height' refer to when specified for table cells.
</blockquote>

Note: IE also starts a new block formatting context with a block with specified width.
</dl>



<h2>Basic rules</h2>

<p>A percentage height is resolved against the generated box's containing block.

<p>If the containing block is computed to auto, the percentage height resolves to auto, with the exception of boxes that are handled by the keep old row heights (ORH) algorithm (ref ###).

<p>Absolute positioned elements with percentage height is resolved with the actual height of the element, not the computed height.

<p>Otherwise percentage height is resolved as a percentage of the containing elements computed height.


<h3>Containing element</h3>

<p>The definition of containing block varies wildly in this context. See height resolving tables.



<h3>Use old row heights (ORH) algorithm</h3>

<p>The use old row heights algorithm works in two passes. The first pass is a measuring pass, where all percentage content is set to 0 (firefox intrinsic) height. The table row height is then calculated based on the non percentage content and available space in the table.

<p>In the second pass any unresolved percentage height content is resolved against the previously calculated table row height. The actual row height will remain unchanged however.

<p>This algorithm will very often lead to content overflowing their table cells, especially if there is mixed static and percentage height elements in the table.

<p><i>(FIXME how does this apply really)</i>In firefox and webkit (at least) any excess table row height is spread _after_ applying the use old row height algorithm. Unfortunately, interpretation of the ORH algorithm seem to differ a lot between browsers.</i>

<p><i>FIXME anything special to say about nested percentage height tables?</i>

<p><i>FIXME how are relative height tables that are over-constrained (i.e. not affected by percentage height) taken into account in ORH?</i>

<h3>Detailed table row height algorithm</h3>

<p>The height of a table row is at least the height of the tallest content in any cell. <u>But</u> content heights calculated by the ORH algorithm does not affect table row heights.

<p>Excess table height is distributed using the following (<i>FIXME</i>) algorithm.

<p>If IE has two table cells with 100% on top of each other, the table gets twice as high. In opera not.


<h3>Unsorted notes</h3>

<p>Overflow on tables differ. Other browsers seem to have td { overflow:hidden; } by default. Overflow visible does not seem to work in all cases in those browers however...

<p>IE seems to have a min-height on block boxes (and more) of one line-height.</p>
