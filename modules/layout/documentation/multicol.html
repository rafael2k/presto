 <h2>About this document</h2>

 <p>
   This is a description of Opera's implementation of CSS3 multi-column
   layout.</p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>
   CSS defines multi-column
   here: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/</a><br>
   Opera has a complete implementation of this spec, with only one known
   difference, at the time of writing this document: The CSS working group has
   decided that the 'column-span' property take the values 'none' and 'all',
   but this change still hasn't found its way to the candidate recommendation,
   which still says that the possible values are '1' and 'all'.
 </p>

 <h2>Design</h2>

 <p>
   Content inside a multi-column container is laid out pretty much like any
   other container. It does not care much about the "multi-columnness", apart
   from setting the width of the containing block that it establishes to the
   width of a column. It lays content out as if columns didn't exist, which
   results in one long column/container when layout is finished. We refer to
   the content height of this container as "virtual height", and the Y position
   of each child in the layout stack is a "virtual Y". Right before finishing
   layout of the outermost multi-column container, we enter a so-called
   columnization phase, where content is distributed into columns (without
   changing the actual layout structure inside of the container).
 </p>

 <p>
   Note that layout of a multi-column container only requires one reflow pass,
   unless there are other factors (such as shrink-to-fit) that cause more than
   one pass. This is thanks to the columnizer, which doesn't modify the actual
   layout, but instead creates a "translation pane" for each column, which
   causes the multi-column effect. They are split into columns and the column
   heights are balanced (if required) in one go.
 </p>

 <p>
   During traversal we traverse a multi-column container (and its children)
   once per column. For a given column, we skip irrelevant content before and
   after it.
 </p>

 <h3>Problems</h3>

 <p>
   The approach with single-pass layout has turned out to work quite fine, with
   one exception: nested multi-column containers. In that case we may have to
   guess the height of an inner multi-column container at the time of finishing
   its layout; there's no way to know the actual height until the outer
   multi-column container has decided if it needs to split the inner
   multi-column container into multiple outer columns (which may affect the
   total height of the inner multi-column container). Content following the
   inner multi-column container will depend on the guessed height, and if it
   later (when being columnized via the outermost multi-column container's
   columnizer) turns out that we guessed wrong, we have to try our best to
   compensate for that on successive content, by moving such content downwards
   (or upwards) in the layout structure. This is evil. Adding another reflow
   pass could have been a better idea. Making sure that we don't get circular
   dependencies and countless reflow iterations would be a challenge then,
   though.
 </p>

 <h2>Implementation</h2>

 <h3>Class overview</h3>

 <p>
   In the layout box/content structure multi-column support is implemented with
   a class called <span class="class">MultiColumnContainer</span>. It lays out
   child content pretty much in the same way as a regular Container. It does
   not care much about the "multi-columnness", apart from setting the width of
   the containing block that it establishes to the width of a column. It lays
   content out as if columns didn't exist, which results in one long column
   when layout is finished. Upon finishing layout, we enter a so-called
   columnization phase, where content is distributed into columns (without
   actually changing the layout structure). The multi-column effect is achieved
   by creating one <span class="class">Column</span> object per column, and
   each <span class="class">Column</span> object has an X and Y translation,
   which makes the object function as a "translation pane". That, together with
   some clipping, causes the multi-column effect.
 </p>

 <p>
   The only class exposed the rest of the layout engine is
   <span class="class">MultiColumnContainer</span>. There are other classes in
   the multi-column implementation, but they are only used by
   <span class="class">MultiColumnContainer</span>.
 </p>

 <p>
   One such class has already been
   mentioned: <span class="class">Column</span>, of which we instantiate one
   per column. It serves as a "translation pane" for the column (translate from
   the container's original coordinates to the column's coordinate system). It
   also knows which elements the column starts with and ends with.
   A <span class="class">Column</span> object is a chain in a linked list
   of <span class="class">Column</span> objects. Together they form a row. The
   class <span class="class">ColumnRow</span> holds the list of
   <span class="class">Column</span>
   objects. A <span class="class">ColumnRow</span> is a chain in a linked list
   of <span class="class">ColumnRow</span> objects. The linked list has its
   dedicated
   class: <span class="class">ColumnRowStack</span>. <span class="class">MultiColumnContainer</span>
   holds this list. The <span class="class">ColumnRow</span>
   and <span class="class">Column</span> objects are built when the
   outermost <span class="class">MultiColumnContainer</span> is being
   columnized, right before finishing layout of this
   element. The <span class="class">ColumnRow</span>
   and <span class="class">Column</span> objects are used during traversal, to
   position and clip each column traversed.
 </p>

 <p>
   There are two state classes, used to carry out two different operations. One
   is used during columnization to build
   the <span class="class">ColumnRow</span>
   and <span class="class">Column</span> objects. It is
   called <span class="class">Columnizer</span>. The other state class only
   reads from <span class="class">Column</span>
   and <span class="class">ColumnRow</span>, and it is used to find out which
   <span class="class">Column</span>(s) a given element belongs to. It is
   called <span class="class">ColumnFinder</span>. Traversing is expensive, so
   this class saves us some time, if all we need to know is the actual
   whereabouts of some box inside of a multicol container.
 </p>

 <p>The class <span class="class">ColumnBoundaryElement</span> is used to keep
   track of where a <span class="class">Column</span> starts and where it
   stops. A start or stop element may be
   a <span class="class">Line</span>, <span class="class">BlockBox</span>,
   <span class="class">LayoutBreak</span>, <span class="class">TableRowBox</span>,
   <span class="class">TableCaptionBox</span>
   or <span class="class">TableRow</span>. This information is used during
   traversal, to know where to begin traversing and when to end. It is also
   used by <span class="class">ColumnFinder</span>.
 </p>

 <p>
   There are two classes of which instances are created during layout and
   consumed (and removed) during columnization. They are used to keep track of
   explicit column/row/page breaks, and spanned elements ('column-span:
   all'). They are called <span class="class">MultiColBreakpoint</span>
   and <span class="class">SpannedElm</span>. A spanned element is considered
   an explicit break point, since it will terminate any previous row of
   columns, and force the columnizer to balance the column heights.
 </p>

 <h3>Paged media</h3>

 <p>
   Multi-column layout and paged media layout have a lot in common, but their
   implementations are still separate. When doing paged media layout and
   multi-column layout at the same time (e.g. when printing a web page that has
   a multi-column container), however, the regular paged media layout code in
   Opera is not used. Then the columnizer takes care of pagination.
 </p>

 <p>
   In the future, we should consider consolidating those two implementations. A
   page in paged media is little different from a column in a multi-column
   container, and could therefore conceivably be represented by
   a <span class="class">Column</span> object (which then might need a better
   name, but that's another story).
 </p>

 <h2>Improvements to consider</h2>

 <ul>
   <li>Support orphans and widows</li>
   <li>Consolidate paged media layout and multi-column layout</li>
   <li>Improve support for nesting of multi-column containers (this will
     probably require us to do multiple layout passes)</li>
   <li>Bounding-box handling. If columns overflow the multi-column container
     (because there are too many of them), we increase the bounding box
     properly. However, if child content overflows the multi-column container,
     we don't.</li>
 </ul>
