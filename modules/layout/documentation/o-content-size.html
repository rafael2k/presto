 <h2>About this document</h2>

 <p>Like the flexroot document in the same directory, this document
   aims for specifying how things should work. We try not to deal with
   implementation details or bugs in Opera more than necessary
   here.</p>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p><tt>o-content-size</tt> is a opera extension to with width and height
   properties. It is primarily aimed at iframes and the gist of it is
   to make the size iframes adapt the size to its embedded document.</p>

 <h2>Related works</h2>

 Mozilla has <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80713'>patches</a>
 that does something similar.

 <h2>Behavior</h2>

 <h3>Propagation of information between documents</h3>

 <p>The only information propagated from the parent document to the
   embedded document in the initial width, if set in the parent
   document. The default width is zero.</p>

 <p>The width and height of the embedded document is propagated to the
   element that embeds the document.</p>

 <h2>Behavior</h2>

 <p>The size of the initial containing block of an embedded document
   is <width> times 0. By having the height set to 0 initially, we
   avoid any dual dependencies between parent document and embedded
   document.</p>

 <p>When the layout of the embedded document has been completed, the
   parent document should adjust the size of the element that
   referenced the embedded document. It should use the overflow
   bounding box of the root element in the embedded document to
   determine the size.  This means that floats, fixed and absolute
   positioned elements, and other overflowing children, are included.</p>

 <h2>Application to non-documents</h2>

 <p>The <tt>o-content-size</tt> property value only gives special behavior to
   object and iframe elements that link to document content (e.g. html
   or text files). For other content, like images, <tt>o-content-size</tt>
   behaves as the value 'auto'.</p>

 <p>For embedded SVG documents, <tt>o-content-size</tt> is redundant
   since 'auto' for width and height is defined to take the SVG size
   into account when deciding the size.</p>

 <h2>Discussion</h2>

 <h3>Alternative to <tt>o-content-size</tt></h3>

 <p>It has been raised by Morten (mstensho@opera.com) that it would
   probably be logical to move the -<tt>o-content-size</tt> values out
   of the width and height properties. Instead, let them be values of
   a special property whose sole purpose is to let iframes take their
   default from their embedded document instead of defaulting to the
   standard 300x150 size.</p>

 <h3>Security issue</h3>
 <p>There is also some discussion about security implications of
   adjusting the size of an iframe according to its content since
   information (the height) leaks from one document to the other.</p>
