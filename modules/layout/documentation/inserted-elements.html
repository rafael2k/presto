 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>In some situations the layout engine needs to insert HTML elements
   on its own. There are several categories, including the following:</p>

 <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">anonymous
   table boxes</a></li>

   <li>the
   '<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#propdef-content">content</a>'
   property (which are normally specified
   on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#before-after-content">::before
   and ::after pseudo elements</a>, but in Opera (as specified in CSS
   3) we also support it on any other element)</li>

   <li>the ::first-letter pseudo element</li>

   <li>the ::first-line pseudo element (not documented here)</li>

   <li>Links with ALT text for AREA elements inside MAP elements (not
   documented here)</li>
</ul>

 <p>A layout box for a child element is created when and if
 Box::LayoutChildren() decides to. It then calls
 LayoutProperties::CreateChildLayoutBox(). This method will call
 CreateLayoutBox() on the child, and this method will cause necessary
 elements to be inserted by the layout engine.</p>

 <p>Elements inserted by the layout engine will have their
 HE_InsertType set to HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT (see
 HTML_Element::GetInserted()).</p>

 <h2>Anonymous table elements</h2>

 <div class="ref">
   Spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">17.2.1
   Anonymous table objects</a><br>

   Code: LayoutProperties::CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement()<br>
 </div>

 <h3>Insertion rules</h3>

 <p>A TableCellBox (display:table-cell) requires a TableRowBox
 (display:table-row) as parent. A TableRowBox requires a
 TableRowGroupBox (display:table-row-group, table-header-group or
 table-footer-group) as parent. A TableRowGroupBox requires
 TableContent (display:table or inline-table) as parent. A
 TableColGroupBox (display:table-column or table-column-group) also
 requires TableContent as parent. This is pretty much in accordance
 with the spec, although it's somewhat stricter, in that the spec
 doesn't require a table-row-group between a (inline-)table and a
 table-row, while Opera requires this in order to work. This is just
 an implementation detail that cannot be observed from the outside
 (via scripts or whatever).</p>

 <p><small>(Note: the above paragraph ought to say something about
 TableCaptionBox as well, but we're currently too buggy (see
 bug <a href="https://bugs.opera.com/browse/CORE-26668">CORE-26668</a>)</small></p>

 <p>Furthermore, a non-table* box as child of a table* box that isn't
 a TableCellBox or a TableCaptionBox requires a TableCellBox
 (display:table-cell) as parent.</p>

 <p>When we lay out a document that has a structure that doesn't
 fulfill these requirements, we need to create and insert elements
 (and create layout boxes for them) to correct the structure. When an
 element E is reparented under a new element I, consecutive siblings
 og E may also be moved under I. Consecutive siblings with the same
 display type as E (or with no layout at all, e.g. display:none) will
 always be reparented under I. In addition, if E is not a table* box,
 any consecutive that also isn't a table* box will be reparented under
 I.</p>

 <h3>Implementation</h3>

 <h4>Inserting a parent</h4>

 <p>LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox() calls CreateBox() which calls
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() if the display type is relevant
 (table-cell, table-row, table-row-group, table-header-group,
 table-footer-group, table-column,
 table-column-group). CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() will check
 if the element E needs a different parent I, and if so, create and
 insert the parent I. Then move <b>all</b> consecutive siblings (with
 the exception of any ::after pseudo-element) under I. The spec says
 that only the consecutive siblings with the same display type as E
 should be moved, but at this point in the code we cannot tell the
 siblings' display type (the cascade hasn't been calculated for them
 yet). Therefore we move all of them down. If it later turns out that
 they don't belong down there, they will be moved back up. When
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() has inserted a parent I, it
 returns INSERTED_PARENT. This return value informs the caller (in
 this case it ultimately means Box::LayoutChildren()) about the fact
 that the child it just attempted to lay out got a parent inserted,
 which means that before it can lay out that child, it needs to lay
 out the parent I (and that parent's siblings, if
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() didn't move them all down under
 I).</p>

 <p>This procedure will be repeated if there are several missing table
 elements in the structure.</p>

 <p>Example 1:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="table" style="display:table;">
     <div id="cell" style="display:table-cell;"></div>
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>The layout box for 'table' will be created and laid out
 normally. No correction will happen at this point. When attempting to
 create a box for 'cell', CheckAndInsertMissingTableElements() will
 insert a table-row parent of 'cell':</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
       <div id="cell" style="display:table-cell;"></div>
     </tr>
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>... and return INSERTED_PARENT. No box
 created. Box::LayoutChildren() will have the wits to go to the
 child's parent before it continues, and attempt to create a layout
 box for that one instead. I.e. it will try to lay out
 'row'. CheckAndInsertMissingTableElements() will insert a
 table-row-group parent of row':</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div id="cell" style="display:table-cell;"></div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>... and return INSERTED_PARENT. No box
 created. Box::LayoutChildren() will have the wits to go to the
 child's parent before it continues, and attempt to create a layout
 box for that one instead. I.e. it will try to lay out
 'row-group'. This time there will be no new element inserted and
 layout will proceed without any further insertions from here.</p>

 <p>Example 2:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
 </xmp>

 <p>'row' needs a row-group parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
     <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
   </tbody>
 </xmp>

 <p>'row-group' needs a table parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>... and we're good to go. Note that no table-cell was inserted, as
 there is no content that requires it.</p>

 <h4>Promoting children that didn't belong under the parent after all</h4>

 <p>As mentioned in the previous paragraph,
 LayoutProperties::CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() has no way of
 determining that consecutive siblings of an element E (that just got
 a parent I inserted) have the same display type as E, and will
 therefore typically move <b>all</b> consecutive siblings of E under
 I. It is not until we try to lay out such a sibling S that we can
 tell what display type it has. LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox()
 calls CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() when the element isn't a
 table-cell or table-caption and the parent is TableContent,
 TableRowGroupBox or TableRowBox. This is the code that takes care of
 inserting a child when necessary, but it will also detect incorrect
 reparenting done as described in the previous paragraph here. If
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() finds incorrect reparenting of
 element S, it will promote it and all its consecutive siblings to
 siblings of I, and return ELEMENT_MOVED_UP. The caller (in this case
 it ultimately means Box::LayoutChildren()) will then know that the
 child it tried to lay out has been moved up in the hierarchy, along
 with its consecutive siblings. This means that Box::LayoutChildren()
 can return and have the parent's Box::LayoutChildren() process the
 new children it just got.</p>

 <p>Example:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
   <div id="block"></div>
 </xmp>

 <p>'row' needs a row-group parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
     <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
     <div id="block"></div>
   </tbody>
 </xmp>

 <p>'row-group' needs a table parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
       <div id="block"></div>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>We can now lay out 'table', 'row-group' and 'row' without any
 further tree changes. When reaching 'block', however,
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() has to detect the situation that
 'block' has an inserted table-row-group parent. It doesn't fit there,
 so we have to promote it:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
     </tbody>
     <div id="block"></div>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>Box::LayoutChildren on the row-group can now finish - it suddenly
 has no more children, as 'block' was promoted. Return to the parent's
 (table) LayoutChildren(), which will try to lay out
 'block'. CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() will see that 'block'
 has a layout-inserted table parent. It doesn't fit there
 either. Promote it again:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <div id="row" style="display:table-row;"></div>
     </tbody>
   </table>
   <div id="block"></div>
 </xmp>

 <p>Box::LayoutChildren on the table can now finish - it suddenly has
 no more children, as 'block' was promoted. Return to the parent's
 (whatever that is; it's not shown in this example) LayoutChildren(),
 which will try to lay out 'block'. This time everything is okay, and
 no further tree modifications are necessary.</p>

 <h4>Inserting a table-cell</h4>

 <p>LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox() calls
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() when the element isn't a
 table-cell or table-caption and the parent is TableContent,
 TableRowGroupBox or TableRowBox.</p>

 <p>If a non-table* element E is inside of a table structure, but E is
 no table-* element and its parent isn't table-cell or table-caption,
 E needs a table-cell parent inserted.
 CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() will take care of this.</p>

 <p>Example 3:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
     HEST
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>Try to lay out 'row-group'. It needs a table parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <div id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       HEST
     </div>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>Try to lay out 'table'. OK. Try to lay out 'row-group'. OK. Try to
 lay out text node 'HEST'. It needs a table-cell parent, because its
 current parent is either table, table-row-group or table-row
 (i.e. it's inside of a table structure, but the structure is
 incomplete), and this parent is a real DOM element:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <div id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <td HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="cell" style="display:table-cell;">
	 HEST
       </td>
     </div>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>Try to lay out 'cell'. It needs a table-row parent:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <div id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <td HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="cell" style="display:table-cell;">
	   HEST
	 </td>
       </tr>
     </div>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>Try to lay out 'row'. OK. Try to lay out 'cell'. OK. Try to lay
 out text node 'HEST'. OK.</p>

 <h2>Generated content</h2>

 <div class="ref">
   Spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#before-after-content">12.1
   The :before and :after pseudo-elements</a><br>

   Spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#content">12.2
   The 'content' property</a><br> Code:

   LayoutProperties::AddGeneratedContent()<br>

   Code: LayoutProperties::CreatePseudoElement()<br>

   Code: LayoutProperties::CreatePseudoReplacedElement()<br>
 </div>

 <h3>::before and ::after</h3>

 <p>The layout engine finds out if an element should have a ::before
 or ::after element associated with it, by calling HTML_Element's
 HasBefore() or HasAfter(). It does this during creation of the DOM
 element's layout box, in LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox().</p>

 <p>We will add a ::before pseudo-element as the first child of a DOM
 element on which the ::before selector matches, and an ::after
 pseudo-element as the last child of said DOM element.</p>

 <p>The following piece of HTML:</p>

 <xmp>
   <style>#elm::before, #elm::after { content:"xxx" }</style>
   <div id="elm"> HEST </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>would result in the following tree for layout:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="elm">
     <div::before HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</div::before>
     HEST
     <div::after HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</div::after>
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <p>LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox() calls CreatePseudoElement() to
 create a child that represents the ::before or ::after
 pseudo-element. When CreateLayoutBox() eventually is called on these
 children, it calls AddGeneratedContent(), which will process the
 'content' property and add child elements as needed. In the example
 above, it just needs to add a Markup::HTE_TEXT HTML_Element that holds the
 text 'xxx', one for ::before and one for ::after.</p>

 <h3>Specifying the 'content' property directly on a DOM element</h3>

 <p>In Opera (like CSS3 suggests), the 'content' property is supported
 on every element, not just ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. When
 the 'content' property is specified on an element, it means that no
 child DOM elements should get layout boxes.</p>

 <p>LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox() calls AddGeneratedContent() to
 process the 'content' property and insert appropriate child
 elements. These elements will be inserted after any DOM children that
 the element may have, but before the ::after pseudo-element, if it
 has one.</p>

 <p>As previously mentioned, when there are elements inserted under a
 DOM element because of the 'content' property, the children of that
 DOM element should not get layout boxes. We let the computed value of
 the 'display' property for these DOM children be 'none'. There's code
 in HTMLayoutProperties::GetCssProperties() to achieve that.</p>

 <p>The following piece of HTML:</p>

 <xmp>
   <style>
     #elm::before, #elm::after { content:"xxx" }
     #elm { content:"sau" }
   </style>
   <div id="elm"><span>HEST</span></div>
 </xmp>

 <p>would result in the following tree for layout:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div id="elm">
     <div::before HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</div::before>
     <span style="display:none;">HEST</span>
     <div HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT style="display:inline;">sau</div>
     <div::after HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</div::after>
   </div>
 </xmp>

 <h3>Replaced content with ::before and ::after</h3>

 <p>For replaced content there's some extra complexity. The CSS 2.1
 spec doesn't define it properly (in fact, it explicitly says that it
 does not "fully define the interaction of :before and :after with
 replaced elements (such as IMG in HTML)"). Since ::before and ::after
 are implemented as first and last child of the DOM element, it
 becomes problematic for replaced content, since such elements cannot
 really have children, at least not as far as the layout engine is
 concerned.</p>

 <p>We solve this by creating a "pseudo" element that holds the actual
 ReplacedContent, which will be a child of the actual DOM
 element. Then we add any ::before element as the first child of the
 DOM element, and any ::after element as the last child.</p>

 <p>The following piece of HTML:</p>

 <xmp>
   <style>#elm::before, #elm::after { content:"xxx" }</style>
   <input id="elm">
 </xmp>

 <p>would result in the following tree for layout:</p>

 <xmp>
   <input id="elm">
     <input::before HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</input::before>
     <input id="inner" HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>
     <input::after HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT>xxx</input::after>
   </input>
 </xmp>

 <p>The outer INPUT 'elm' is the DOM node. It will get a
 ShrinkToFitContainer as content, and whatever Box type the properties
 dictate (in this example it will be InlineBlockBox). The
 ShrinkToFitContainer will make room for the ::before and ::after
 elements beside the actual replaced content, when necessary. The
 inner INPUT 'inner' holds the layout box for the actual replaced
 content, in this example an InlineBlockBox with
 InputFieldContent.</p>

 <h2>::first-letter</h2>

  <div class="ref">
   Spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-letter">5.12.2
     The :first-letter pseudo-element</a><br>
   Code: LayoutProperties::CreateTextBox()<br>
  </div>

  <p>LayoutProperties::CreateLayoutBox() calls CreateBox(), which
  calls CreateTextBox(). A pseudo-element for the first letter will be
  created here, and under it, a text node. These will even get their
  own layout boxes and be laid out before CreatBox() returns.</p>

  <p>This piece of HTML:</p>

  <xmp>
    <style>div::first-letter { font-size:2em; }</style>
    <div>hest</div>
  </xmp>

  <p>would result in a layout tree like this:</p>

  <xmp>
    <div>
      <div::first-letter HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT style="display:inline; font-size:2em;">h</div::first-letter>hest
    </div>
  </xmp>

  <p>Note that the whole word 'hest' is still intact as a DOM text
  node. We have special code that makes sure that the layout box for
  the text DOM node starts at the second character when it follows a
  ::first-letter pseudo-element.</p>

 <h2>Recreation of layout boxes</h2>
 <div class="ref">
   Code: LayoutProperties::RemoveElementsInsertedByLayout()<br>
   Code: HTML_Element::MarkExtraDirty()<br>
 </div>

 <h3>Extra dirty elements near layout-inserted elements</h3>

 <p>When any box needs to be recreated (because the 'display' property
 changes, for instance), it is marked extra dirty, by calling
 HTML_Element::MarkExtraDirty(). This will cause the layout box of
 that element, and any layout boxes of descendants of that element, to
 be deleted and recreated (although that will happen lazily, in the
 next reflow pass).</p>

 <p>If the element, or the element's parent, that is marked extra
 dirty is inserted by layout, we also mark the contiguous chain of
 ancestors that are inserted by layout extra dirty. We also mark the
 non-inserted parent of such a chain extra dirty.</p>

 <p>This is something that we should try to improve (there are
 performance issues because of this, although on the brighter side,
 the code gets "simpler" - or at least less insanely complicated), but
 currently there are a few situations where it's necessary to mark the
 non-inserted parent of layout-inserted elements extra dirty. For
 instance, if a ::before selector on a DOM element is added after the
 DOM element has been laid out, the only way for the layout engine to
 create and insert the pseudo-element is by recreating the layout box
 of the DOM element. currently necessary for ::before, ::after and
 ::first-letter pseudo-elements, since these pseudo-elements are
 inserted as part of creating the layout box for the parent DOM
 element. Example:</p>

 <xmp>
   <style>.x::before { content:"HEST"; }</style>
   <div></div>
 </xmp>

 <p>If we later set class="x" on the DIV element, there are currently
 no other ways of creating its ::before pseudo-element than to
 recreate the layout box of the DIV DOM element.</p>

 <h3>Layout-inserted table elements</h3>

 <p>Adding or removing DOM nodes, or changing their CSS properties
 (most notably the 'display' property, may have interesting effects on
 nearby layout-inserted table elements. The most interesting effects
 are probably when such a change causes a layout-inserted table to be
 split into two tables, or when two tables are joined into one.</p>

 <xmp>
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
 </xmp>

 <p>This piece of HTML will cause the layout engine to wrap the two
 table-cell elements inside of one layout-inserted table-row element,
 which will be child of a layout-inserted table-row-group, which will
 be child of a layout-inserted table. Layout will see a tree like
 this:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>If we now, via a script, insert an IMG element between the two
 table-cell elements (let's be even more specific: we insert it before
 the second DIV element using insertBefore()), we end up with a DOM
 tree looking a lot like this:</p>

 <xmp>
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
   <img src="hest.jpg">
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
 </xmp>

 <p>That will affect the layout-inserted table structure
 drastically. The two table cells are no longer adjacent sibling
 boxes, and will live in two different tables. Layout will see
 this:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
   <img src="hest.jpg">
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>One table suddenly became two. Fancy-schmancy, huh?</p>

 <p>If we remove the IMG element again, the two tables should be
 joined back into one, and we will have the same layout tree as
 initially.</p>

 <p>There's some special code to handle split and join
 situations. Let's take a closer look at what's going on here.</p>

 <p>The need for a split isn't detected per se in this particular
 case. Inserting an IMG beside the second table-cell DIV will mark the
 IMG extra dirty (as always when inserting an element). Since its
 parent is also inserted by layout (the table-row), it will also be
 marked extra dirty. The same happens to the table-row-group and the
 table. Since we also mark the parent of a layout-inserted element, we
 actually end up marking the DIVs' parent (whatever that is) extra
 dirty. In this case it's completely unnecessary, but since we don't
 differentiate between layout-inserted table-completion elements and
 ::first-letter, ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, we mark the
 parent extra dirty as well. Box::LayoutChildren() calls
 LayoutProperties::RemoveElementsInsertedByLayout() on every extra
 dirty child, which removes any children inserted by layout (and it
 will do this recursively). It will also remove the child itself (and
 continue layout on the first non-inserted child), if the child itself
 is inserted by layout. Laying out the the DIVs' DOM parent (let's
 pretend it's the BODY element), which is extra dirty, will remove all
 layout-inserted elements in this document. We will then rely on
 LayoutProperties::CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() inserting the
 necessary structure "on top of" and invisible to the DOM.</p>

 <p>The (potential) need for a table join is in this case discovered
 when removing the IMG element, in HTML_Element::Remove(), which
 discovers that the IMG element has a layout box, and its preceding
 layout box is inserted by layout and its a table structural element
 (it's a TABLE in this case). When this is the case, the preceding
 layout-inserted layout box is marked extra dirty, since it may be
 that the consecutive sibling of the element removed (the IMG) now
 suddenly belongs in the same table as its preceding sibling. At this
 point it's pretty hard to tell if a join is really going to happen,
 but we just have to be prepared for that possibility. Then, during
 reflow, Box::LayoutChildren() will remove layout-inserted elements
 that have extra dirty parents or are extra dirty
 themselves. CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement() will then find the
 first DIV, rebuild a table element structure (table-row,
 table-row-group, table) around it, and include all its siblings in
 this table structure as well.</p>

 <p>Let's give a slightly different example, where we change the
 display type instead of inserting/removing a DOM element. We start
 with this DOM tree:</div>

 <xmp>
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
   <img style="display:none;" src="hest.jpg">
   <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
 </xmp>

 <p>The layout tree will then look like this:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
	 <img style="display:none;" src="hest.jpg">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>Changing IMG's display type from 'none' to 'inline' will give us a
 layout tree with two tables, identical to the one in the previous
 example:</p>

 <xmp>
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
   <img style="display:inline;" src="hest.jpg">
   <table HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="table" style="display:table;">
     <tbody HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row-group" style="display:table-row-group;">
       <tr HE_INSERTED_BY_LAYOUT id="row" style="display:table-row;">
	 <div style="display:table-cell;">xxx</div>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>
 </xmp>

 <p>How we discover the need for split and join is quite different in
 this example, though.</p>

 <p>The need for a table split is detected when we try to create a
 layout box for the IMG, and discover, in
 LayoutProperties::CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement(), that an inline
 box created by IMG cannot be a child of the layout-inserted table-row
 - which means that the IMG element and all its siblings must be moved
 upwards in the tree. It will do so and return ELEMENT_MOVED_UP. At
 the point of creating a layout box for the second table-cell, we
 realize that we need to wrap it inside of <b>another</b> table
 structure.</p>

 <p>The need for the table join is discovered by
 Box::LayoutChildren(). By changing the display type on the IMG
 element, it gets marked extra dirty. When Box::LayoutChildren()
 reaches the first layout-inserted table (it's still a sibling of the
 IMG that was just marked extra dirty, so it will be visited during
 reflow), Box::LayoutChildren() will see that it's a layout-inserted
 table element. It will then look ahead on its consecutive siblings
 and see that there is no non-extra-dirty layout box between the
 layout-inserted table element and the next extra dirty element (the
 IMG). Could it be that the extra dirty element (the IMG) and its
 consecutive siblings suddenly belongs under the first layout-inserted
 table? Who knows - we haven't calculated the cascade for it yet. So
 we have to set the first table element (which wasn't dirty at all)
 extra dirty, to re-run the CheckAndInsertMissingTableElement()
 machinery.</p>
