 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <em>SPDY</em> is a binary protocol designed by Google to mitigate many HTTP problems like additional round trips for connection 
    setup and slow-start delays.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quoting SPDY Protocol - Draft 3:
  </p>
  <p>
    “ISPDY adds a framing layer for multiplexing multiple, concurrent streams across a single TCP connection (or any reliable transport stream).
    The framing layer is optimized for HTTP-like request-response streams, such that applications which run over HTTP today can work over SPDY
    with little or no change on behalf of the web application writer"
  </p>
  <p>
    ...
  </p>
  <p>
    "SPDY is intended to be as compatible as possible with current web-based applications. This means that, from the perspective 
    of the server business logic or application API, the features of HTTP are unchanged. To achieve this, all of the application 
    request and response header semantics are preserved, although the syntax of conveying those semantics has changed."
  </p>
  <p>
    This document doesn't describe the protocol itself but only it's imeplementation in the Opera Browser. To learn more about the SPDY protocol please read:
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft2">SPDY/2</a> and <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft3">SPDY/3</a>
    drafts.
  </p>

  <h2 id="supportnotes">Support notes</h2>
  <p>
    Opera's SPDY implementation currently supports all features of the spdy/2 and spdy/3 protocols, except for:
    <ul>
      <li>
        PUSH and HINT: there is no deployment of PUSH and HINT usage on the web (as far as we know), and no way to use it with mod_spdy so we decided 
        not to implement it for the time being, until we have something to test it on, and more evidence of actual usage.        
      </li>
      <li>
        The Alternate-Protocol header: neither Chrome nor Firefox have implemented this in the way described in SPDY draft 2, 
        moreover SPDY draft 3 does not even mention that header anymore, so we decided to not support it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="supportnotes">Settings persistence</h3>
  <p>
    Quoting SPDY Protocol - Draft 3:
  </p>
  <p>
    "A SETTINGS frame contains a set of id/value pairs for communicating configuration data about how the two endpoints may communicate. 
    SETTINGS frames can be sent at any time by either endpoint, are optionally sent, and are fully asynchronous. When the server is the sender, 
    the sender can request that configuration data be persisted by the client across SPDY sessions and returned to the server in future communications."
  </p>
  <p>
    After considering privacy issues, settings persistence feature has been implemented with the following restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        settings are not persisted for domains that we don't allow to persist cookies for (checked with <code>serverName->GetAcceptCookies()</code>),
      </li>
      <li>
        settings are not persisted for connections created for requests made in privacy mode,
      </li>
      <li>
        settings are forgotten after 10 days of being unused (the expire time is controlled by <em>PrefsCollectionNetwork::SpdySettingsPersistenceTimeout</em>),
      </li>
      <li>
        settings persistence can be disabled in preferences (<em>PrefsCollectionNetwork::SpdySettingsPersistence</em>),
      </li>
      <li>
        persisted settings are cleared along with cookies on user's demand (as required by the spec).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
 <h2 id="designoverview">Design overview</h2>
  <p>
    The design goal for the implementation was to minimize changes to existing HTTP protocol stack and thereby lower the
    regression risk in the good old HTTP. On the other hand we wanted to re-use the code responsible for creating and managing HTTP
    connections.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="toplevel">Top level design</h3>
  <p>
    From the <em>HTTP_1_1</em> class we've extracted <em>HttpRequestsHandler</em> abstract class, which became a base for all
    classes capable of handling HTTP requests (represented by <em>HTTP_Request</em> class). In result we've ended up with a model shown on
    the UML diagram below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="img/HttpStack.png"/>
    <img src="img/HttpRequestsHandler.png"/>
  </p>

  <h3 id="spdyconnection">The SpdyConnection class + some overview of Abstract SPDY layer</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>SpdyConnection</em> class inherits from <em>HttpRequestsHandler</em> and therefore is able to handle HTTP requests. As opposed to <em>HTTP_1_1</em>,
    <em>SpdyConnection</em> doesn't need to be known to (or even worse - friended by) <em>HTTP_Request</em> class. It's the connection that handles requests 
    not the other way around so the request shouldn't be aware of what kind of connection is taking care of it. The dependency between <em>HTTP_1_1</em> and <em>HTTP_Request</em>
    has been kept though, to avoid the risk of regressions in HTTP protocol. For clarity, the <code>HTTP_1_1 conn</code> field in the <em>HTTP_Request</em> 
    class has been renamed to <code>HTTP_1_1 http_conn</code>.
    <em>SpdyConnection</em> doesn't know much about the SPDY protocol, it just handles various connection and protocol events, adding/counting/removing requests, 
    and when needed - moving unfinished requests to another connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    For dealing with the SPDY protocol the <em>SpdyConnection</em> class needs to know only three of the classes from <em>Abstract SPDY layer</em>.
    Those three classes constitute the external interface of the <em>Abstract SPDY layer</em> which can also be used for other communication, not necessarily
    related to HTTP. They are:
    <ul>
     <li>SpdyFramesHandler</li>
     <li>SpdyFramesHandlerListener</li>
     <li>SpdyStreamController</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the SPDY protocol resources are requested from the server side by opening streams with appropriate headers (and possibly sending data).
      Then the server side may accept the stream and send it's own headers + data in response, or refuse the stream.
      The <em>SpdyFrameHandler</em> class is responsible for creating and handling streams, but it needs to know what headers should be sent and what to do
      with the received data. This is the role of <em>SpdyStreamControler</em>. <em>SpdyStreamControler</em> is a listener and data provider in one.
      It's responsible for providing all information needed for creating the stream and is fed the data loaded from the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make a request the <em>SpdyConnection</em> class calls <code>CreateStreamL()</code> on <code>SpdyFramesHandler</code> and provides 
      a <em>SpdyHTTPRequestHandler</em> (inherited from <em>SpdyStreamController</em>) associated with a given <em>HTTP_Request</em> as a parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UML diagram below shows the dependencies and responsibilities of each classes.

  <h3 id="abstractspdy">Abstract SPDY layer</h3>
  <p>
    The Abstract SPDY layer provides a framing layer which multiplexes a TCP connection into independent, length-prefixed frames. The goal was to design it in a way 
    that enables using it also for purposes other then carrying HTTP requests. It's interface (decribed above) enables any communication utilizing concurrent 
    streams on a single connection. For that reasons it doesn't know anything about HTTP and in particular about HTTP requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart of the <em>Abstract SPDY layer</em> is <em>SpdyFramesHandler</em> which is responsible for the SPDY framing layer. It parses the incoming data in search 
    of specific headers, handles incoming and outgoing frames for concurrent streams and notifies the listener when it has some data to send or when something requiring it's 
    attention happens in the protocol (e.g. ping timeout, goaway message, protocol error).
  </p>

  <h4 id="frameproducers">Frame producers</h4>
  <p>
    <em>SpdyFramesHandler</em> doesn't produce SPDY frames on its own but keeps a priority ordered list of <em>FrameProducer</em>s that are responsible for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of <em>SpdyFrameProducer</em>s:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyPingController</em> - responsible for sending and answering PING frames,
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdySettingsController</em> - responsible for sending and receiving SETTINGS frames,
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyPushCanceller</em> - responsible for cancelling incoming streams (for the time being we don't support PUSH),
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyStreamHandler</em> - responsible for receiving and producing all stream-related frames (SYNSTREAM, DATA, RESET, WINDOW_UPDATE, etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4 id="dataconsumers">Data consumers</h4>
  <p>
    When receiving data from a server frames can be retrived in many small chunks. In the worst case scenario we could receive a 1-byte length chunk
    which cannot even be parsed as a valid frame header. <em>SpdyFramesHandler</em> buffers received data until it can parse it as a valid frame header.
    In the case of frames having a payload beside the header (like SYN_STREAM, SYN_REPLY, SETTINGS or HEADERS) the incoming payload data is passed to
    appropriate <em>SpdyDataConsumer</em>s. On a single connection there can be only one <em>DataConsumer</em> awaiting payload associated with a recently 
    received frame. If there is one then <em>SpdyFramesHandler</em> keeps a pointer to it. When this pointer is NULL an attempt is made to parse the next 
    incoming data chunk as a frame header again.
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of <em>SpdyDataConsumer</em>s:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>SpdySettingsController</em> - consumes the payload of SETTINGS frames (settings entries),
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyStreamHandler</em> - cosumes the payload of SYN_REPLY, HEADERS or DATA frames,
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyDevNullConsumer</em> - consumes the payload of frames that we decided to ignore,
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>SpdyDecompressingConsumer</em> - decompresses (to preserve the consistency of zlib stream) and discards the payload of frames that we decided to ignore.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The UML diagram below shows the described classes and their dependencies:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="img/AbstractSpdyLayer.png"/>
  </p>

  <h3 id="memorymanagement">Memory management</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike the <em>HTTP_1_1</em>, <em>SpdyConnection</em> handles multiple requests at the same time and it can not operate on a single static memory buffer.
    To solve that problem every received data chunk is added the <em>OpData buffer</em> in the <em>SpdyFramesHandler</em> and shared with <em>data consumer</em>s via 
    copying OpData objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The diagram below shows the data flow in <em>SPDY</em> protocol:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="img/DataFlow.png"/>
  </p>

  <h2 id="improovements">Possible improvements</h2>
  <p>
    PUSH and HINT should be implemented as soon as we have something to test it on, and some evidence of actual usage on the web.
